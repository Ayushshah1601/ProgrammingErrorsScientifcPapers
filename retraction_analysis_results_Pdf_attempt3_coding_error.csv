Published 13 October 2023
This article has been retracted by IOP Publishing after the authors contacted us to advise that the
methodology used in this paper was erroneous and the results presented were unreliable.
Specifically, the environmental parameters for maximum daily temperature and minimum surface
temperature related to the pavement temperature field were incorrectly selected, leading to incorrect
conclusions about the applicability of the chosen type of pavement structure.
After an investigation in line with COPE guidelines, IOP Publishing agrees with these findings and has
decided to retract the work.
IOP Publishing wishes to credit the authors for bringing the issue to our attention.

Published 24 November 2022
This article has been retracted by IOP Publishing following an allegation that this article contains
potential inconsistencies and inaccurate information that may contradict long-established theories.
IOP has investigated in line with COPE guidelines with the help of an independent subject expert, who
agrees the article contains incorrect concepts. As such, the findings of the article may be unreliable, and
IOP Publishing conclude this article should be retracted.
IOP Publishing wishes to credit the anonymous whistleblower for bringing the issue to our attention.
The authors agree to this retraction.
