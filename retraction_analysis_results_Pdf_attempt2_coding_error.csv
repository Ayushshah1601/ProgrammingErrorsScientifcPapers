After publication of our paper, we noticed that Scheme 2, Figure 3, and the accompanying text contained errors in the
configurational assignment ((P)- or (M)-) of intermediates 2, 8 and 10. Also, the inverted configuration should be shown in
Scheme 2. Although the overall findings and conclusions are in no way affected by these errors, we would nonetheless like to
correctthem.Note,thatthesignofopticalrotationsshownthroughouttheSchemes,FiguresandtextinthepaperandESIforall
compounds is not affected at all. The labels of intermediates 2, 8 and 10 should now read as follows (for simplicity, only the

Background / Purpose: This policy outlines editorial standards and COI
considerations for all industry-sponsored journal
supplements
Program Area or Business Line Publications/Communications
Policy Sponsor (Staff Officer): Mike Stokes, Vice President Communications
& Membership
Approving Body: ASPS/PSF Executive Committee (policy has been
previously reviewed and approved by the Publications
Committee)
Authorized Signatories: Joseph Losee, MD, ASPS President
Effective Date of Policy: August 2014, revised by Publications Committee in
March 2020; Further revised June 11, 2021
Next Review Date: June 2024
ASPS POLICY ON PUBLICATION OF JOURNAL SUPPLEMENTS
The Editorial Boards of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and PRS Global Open, and the volunteer and
staff leadership of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, have reviewed and agreed upon the
necessity, potential value, and validity of publishing commercially sponsored supplements to the
journals. The following sets forth the policy adopted by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons
(“ASPS”) for the publication of supplements in the journals “Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery” (“PRS”)
and “PRS Global Open” (“PRS GO”) – collectively referred to as “the Journals.” This policy will be
reviewed and potentially modified every three years.
I.Statement of Purpose
Supplements to the Journals are collections of papers that deal with plastic surgery issues or topics, are
published as a separate issue or as part of a regular issue and are usually funded by third-party sources.
Supplements serve useful purposes including: education, exchange of research information, ease of
access to focused content, and improved cooperation between academic and corporate entities. This
policy also applies to theme issues or special series that receive external funding and/or have Guest
Editors (see Guest Editor expectation in Appendix A). As with any other content submitted to the
Journals, and even more importantly because of the potential for conflict of interest, sponsored
supplements must meet rigorous disclosure, procedural, peer review, and authorship requirements.
II.Policy
1.A Supplement that Requires Manuscript Solicitation
1To ensure timely publication of the supplement and to provide a clear business plan, funding for the
supplement should, whenever possible, be arranged before the supplement proposal is submitted for
review to the PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE and manuscripts are solicited. Supplements may be funded by
single or multiple sponsors. On some occasions, when sponsorship is not yet finalized but can be
reasonably predicted, proposal to the Publications Committee and manuscript solicitation may begin
before sponsorship is obtained in the interest of allowing maximum time for authors and reviewers.
In cases where a supplement proposal is submitted to the Publications Committee for review and
manuscripts are solicited prior to obtaining a funding source, ASPS will, in cooperation with the
Publisher, seek appropriate sources of financial support. The Publisher and ASPS Executive Vice
President or his/her designee will present the potential sponsor(s) and the specific financial
arrangements to the Publications Committee. If manuscripts have been accepted for the supplement
but no sponsorship can be obtained in reasonable time, the accepted manuscripts will be published in
regular issues of the Journal upon review and approval from the Editor-in-Chief.
Due to the time-sensitive nature and long lead time required of supplements, proposals will be sent via
email to the Publications Committee for review and recommendation. If time allows, the proposal and
the Publications Committee’s recommendation will be submitted for final approval of the Executive
Committee during its next meeting; otherwise, it will be circulated via email to the EC for approval.
2. Supplement Based on a Conference or Symposium
Supplements that are required to be published in time for a conference or symposium need to be
planned well in advance of the meeting to ensure that the supplement will be available either at the
time of the meeting or shortly thereafter.
3. Vendor-Initiated Supplement
A supplement initiated by a vendor sponsor, whether based on a consensus conference or otherwise,
will go through the standard approval process.
4. Undue Industry Influence
A proposed supplement that contains a level of industry influence that creates the risk of bias or undue
influence on professional judgment or objectivity will be considered inappropriate by the Publications
and/or Executive committees and unacceptable for publication in PRS or PRS Global Open.
The following rules apply to all PRS and PRS Global Open supplements and are implemented to avoid
undue industry influence:
• Any advertisements, although allowable in a supplement, must be corporate messaging only
(i.e., no product or services can be specified in these advertisements). Corporate advertisements
can be included within the table of contents only.
• No advertising of any kind can be included within the article-well portion of supplement
(scientific and educational portion of the supplement).
• An employee of a company serving as a sponsor of the supplement cannot serve as supplement
Guest Editor or serve as an expert discussant for any manuscripts.
2• An employee of a company serving as a sponsor cannot serve as lead or corresponding author of
any supplement manuscript.
• An employee of a company serving as a sponsor cannot serve as a peer reviewer for any
supplement manuscripts.
• Sponsor-company employees providing proprietary data must be listed in the
acknowledgements with full disclosures of relation to sponsor.
• Anyone listed as an author on a manuscript must meet the authorship criteria (see below) and
provide full disclosure (“full disclosure” includes all industry relationships, though only related
disclosures will be published).
• The Publications Committee (in consultation with the Conflict of Interest Committee, if
requested) shall determine if the Guest Editor’s conflict of interest rises to a level that
represents undue industry influence.
• At least one Guest Editor of the Supplement must have no financial affiliation nor relationship
with the Supplement sponsor (for at least two years). For supplements based on a sponsor-
funded conference or symposium, the Guest Editor may be permitted to have a relationship
with the sponsor, but this would require additional review for approval by the Conflict of
Interest Committee. Unconflicted guest editors will serve as moderators in any disputes related
to content.
• Should the Editor-in-Chief have any financial affiliation with the Supplement sponsor(s), the
Publications Committee and/or Executive Committee shall determine if the relationship
constitutes a conflict of interest that rises to a level that represents undue industry influence,
and whether the review process will instead be overseen by a Co-eEditor or whether the
proposal is rejected.
5. Authorship Criteria
According to the Council of Science Editors, “Authors are generally defined as persons who have
contributed sufficiently to a scientific report.” The Journals and supplements adhere to this definition. It
is the responsibility of those who did the work to correctly identify authors and contributors to the
work; this determination should be made by reviewing the contributions to the final work by each
potential author. Criteria of authorship include (but are not limited to) study design, research, data
gathering and statistical interpretation, writing, editing, and re-writing. If contributions were not
sufficient to warrant authorship, these contributors can be listed by name in the acknowledgements
section. All acknowledged contributors and authors must provide full disclosures.
The Guest Editor(s) and Editor-in-Chief reserve the right to request a document describing the
contributions of all listed authors.
All listed authors have ultimate accountability for the manuscript.
6. Disclosures
Each author, acknowledged contributor, and reviewer of an article or discussion in a supplement,
including Section Editors, must comply with the Journals’ policy on disclosure of commercial interests
3and must fully disclose all relevant corporate relationships. Once all applicable conflicts of interest are
disclosed, including relevant stock holdings, it is the responsibility of the Editor-in-Chief to make every
effort to limit and manage author and reviewer conflicts of interest.
7. Peer Review
The content of each article in a supplement must be subjected to the corresponding Journal’s peer
review process. The Editor-in-Chief of the Journal, through the manuscript submission and peer review
mechanisms administered by the ASPS Journal Editorial Office, is responsible for the peer review of all
supplement articles. The Editor-in-Chief must make every effort to limit and manage peer reviewer
conflicts of interest.
8. CME
CME is not offered with any supplements, monographs, or similar fully commercially supported
publications.
9. Post-approval changes to the Table of Contents
The PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE and Executive Vice President or his/her
designee will be notified of any changes in sponsorship or substantive changes in the Table of Contents,
subject matter or list of authors in the final version of the supplement.
10. Sponsor Information and the ASPS/PRS disclaimer
Sponsor Information and the ASPS/journal disclaimer will appear on the cover and/or first page of the
table of contents in a simple declarative statement in one of the following formats, depending on the
nature of the support:
• “Publication of this supplement is sponsored by (Name of Sponsoring Organization(s)).
Publication of this supplement does not constitute product or sponsor endorsement by the
American Society of Plastic Surgeons or Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery” (or “PRS Global
Open”).
• ""Publication of this supplement is supported by an unrestricted educational grant from (Name
of Sponsoring Organization(s)). Publication of this supplement does not constitute product or
sponsor endorsement by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons or Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery"" (or “PRS Global Open”).
11. Corporate Logo
If so desired and contractually agreed upon, a non-product specific corporate logo(s) acknowledging
sponsor information, which consists of a Corporate logo against a white page, can be included on the
back cover of the supplement issue.
12. Advertisements
If so desired and contractually agreed upon, corporate (non-product specific) advertising from the
corporation(s) sponsoring the supplement can be included ahead of the scientific content in the
supplement issue. No advertisements can be placed in the “content” portion of the supplement (see
Sec. 4 “Undue Industry Influence”).
13. Title
4The Guest Editor(s) and Editor-in-Chief reserve the right to determine if product or company names can
appear in the title of the supplement.
14. Add-ons
Sponsors will be given the opportunity to include the following, subject to additional costs:
• Level-of-Evidence (LOE) Grading
• Open access (or free online access to readers)
• Promotional marketing plan
15. Promotion of the Supplement
Any press releases or other materials designed to promote the supplement by the sponsor(s) or
Publisher must be approved by ASPS prior to release, and no wide press release can be issued ahead of
the embargo date (date of the supplement’s publication). The following boilerplate text must be
included in any release:
• Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery® is the official journal of the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons (or PRS Global Open is the official open-access journal of the American Society of
Plastic Surgeons) and is published by Wolters Kluwer Health.
• About ASPS: The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) is the world's largest organization
of board-certified plastic surgeons. Representing more than 9,000 member surgeons worldwide,
the Society is recognized as a leading authority and information source on aesthetic and
reconstructive plastic surgery. ASPS comprises more than 92 percent of all board-certified
plastic surgeons in the United States. Founded in 1931, the Society represents physicians
certified by The American Board of Plastic Surgery or The Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Canada. ASPS advances quality care to plastic surgery patients by encouraging high
standards of training, ethics, physician practice and research in plastic surgery.
16. Additional Guest Editor Criteria, Duties and Expectations:
Duties as Guest Editors include:
• Conceptual input for the supplement as a whole
• Creating a Table of Contents, complete with topics for articles and authors
• Assistance creating, keeping, and maintaining the production timeline (including reminding
authors & reviewers; including personal commitment to adhere to the timeline)
• Assistance securing funding or suggesting funding sources for the supplement project
• Assistance as needed with solicitation of author invitations
• Providing contact information for authors
• Interfacing and Communicating with Editor-in-Chief, co-editors and staff in a timely fashion
• Communicating with authors and discussants, when necessary
• Serving as peer reviewer of every article on which you are not an author
• Suggesting other members of peer review panel
• Providing input on the final order of articles and supplement name
• Co-writing the Guest Editors’ introduction to the supplement
5• Working with the Publisher’s advertising team to make contact with potential supplement
sponsors
• Guest editors should write/co-write no more than three articles in the supplement (not
including the introduction)
• No Supplement should have more than three Guest Editors
Among the aforementioned duties, Guest Editors can expect frequent correspondence with the Editorial
Office as they implement decisions and administer the process. When deadlines cannot or may not be
met, Guest Editors must contact the editorial office as soon as this becomes evident.
The Editorial Board and Editor-in-Chief reserve the right to remove a guest editor from a supplement at
any time during the process if it becomes apparent that the co-editor is not performing essential duties
and aforementioned responsibilities.
III. Proposal Review
1. Supplement Proposal
The Editor-in-Chief along with the editorial office staff are responsible for assembling the supplement
proposal and completion of a preliminary review of the supplement materials to eliminate proposals
that are clearly inconsistent with the Policy on Publication of Supplements. Supplements may be based
upon a topic the Editor-in-Chief believes is of interest or importance to the readership and for which
s/he will solicit manuscripts, a future conference or symposium, or initiated by an industry sponsor(s).
Once the Editor-in-Chief completes the initial supplement review, s/he will submit the supplement
proposal to the PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE for further evaluation and recommendation to the
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE for final approval. The proposal submitted by the Editor-in-Chief to the
Publications Committee should include the following:
• The subject matter/title of the supplement
• Proposed Guest Editor(s) along with his/her conflict of interest disclosure statement
• A “mission statement” for the supplement
• Proposed authors, including a pre-selected Editorial Manager Corresponding Author
• A draft table of contents
• Estimated length of the supplement
• List of potential or predetermined sponsors
• Financial arrangements if sponsorship has already been obtained
• Supplement cost analysis
• Description of why the proposed supplement is of potential significance to subscribers/readers
and how the supplement relates to the academic and educational mission of the Journals.
62. Proposal Review
The PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE will review the supplement proposal presented by the Editor-in-Chief
and base its recommendation to approve or reject the supplement upon the following:
• Degree to which the proposed supplement meets the requirements outlined in the Policy on
Publication of Supplements
• Whether the supplement is consistent with the academic and educational mission of the Journal
• Whether an actual or perceived conflict of interest is present
The proposal and the Publications Committee’s recommendation will be submitted to the EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE to approve or reject the supplement.
3. Post-approval Changes
After the EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE’s initial approval of the supplement concept, the Publications
Committee, Executive Vice President or his/her designee will determine if additional approval of the
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE is required if:
• There is a change in sponsorship or the subject matter of the supplement is to be substantially
changed and/or
• If any new proposed author(s) have commercial relationships with the sponsor(s).
4. Final Approval. Once the topic, sponsorship and financial issues have received final approval by the
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, the final decision to publish a supplement (supplement or each individual
article therein) will be made by the Editor-in-Chief, based on the scientific significance, timeliness of the
proposed topic, and the quality of the articles and editorial material to be published.

distortion when one finite metric is embedded into another. While the fairly
involved reduction we presented was correct, the Directed Disjoint Cycle Cover
(DDCC) problem we were reducing from has a polynomial-time algorithm, as
noticed later by Jiri Sgall. Despite much effort, we have not been able to find
an alternate reduction, and it remains open whether our claimed hardness of
approximation results still hold.

Design and Synthesis of Gold-Gadolinium-Core-Shell Nanoparticles as
Contrast Agent: a Smart Way to Future Nanomaterials for Nanomedicine
Applications [Retraction]
Aouidat F, Boumati S, Khan M, Tielens F, Doan BT, Spadavecchia J. Int J Nanomedicine. 2019;14:9309–9324.
The Editor and Publisher of International Journal of Nanomedicine wish to retract the published article. The authors
raised concerns regarding errors that had been made during the calculation of the size of the nanostructures shown in
Figure 2. The sizes reported in the histograms of Figure 2; a1, a2 and a3 were incorrect due to miscalculations that
occurred during analysis of the gold core and polymer shells of the spherical nanostructures represented in TEM images
of Figure 2A. The authors provided the editor with data from the original study and requested to remove the incorrect
histograms and replace them.
However, the Editor determined that this part of the article was integral to the study and the admission of these errors,
because of the miscalculation, meant the data was unreliable and would not accept the correction proposed by the
authors. The Editor requested for the article to be retracted and the authors were notified but do not agree with this
decision.
Our decision-making was informed by our policy on publishing ethics and integrity and the COPE guidelines on
retraction.
The retracted article will remain online to maintain the scholarly record, but it will be digitally watermarked on each page
as “Retracted”.

NOTICE OF RETRACTION
The Journal regretfully retracts the following paper:
The EDA-containing cellular fibronectin induces epithelial mes-
enchymal transition in lung cancer cells through integrin α9β1-
mediated activation of PI3-K /Akt and Erk1/2
Xiaojuan Sun, Pingping Fa, Zhiwen Cui, Ye Xia, Liang Sun,
Zesong Li, Aifa Tang, Yaoting Gui and Zhiming Cai
Carcinogenesis (2014) 35(1): 184–191
doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgt276
(http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/184.full.
pdf+html)
It was brought to the Editor-in-Chief’s attention that there
were significant similarities between this paper and a previ-
ously published and subsequently retracted article in the
American Journal of Physiology–Lung Cellular and Molecular
Physiology: The fibronectin EDA splicing variant induces
epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer cells
through integrin α9β1-mediated activation of PI3-K and Erk
http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00039.2010
Upon further investigation Carcinogenesis’ editorial team had
concerns with the accuracy of the paper’s content as below,
which the author, Dr Xiaojuan Sun, has been unable to explain
to the satisfaction of the Editor-in-Chief: The data sets reported
in the previously retracted publication were included in the
Carcinogenesis paper without significant additions or amend-
ments. There are errors in figures 4B and 6A and there are
inconsistencies in the descriptions of the immunofluorescence
analysis. The lead author, Dr Xiaojuan Sun, accepts responsibil-
ity for the careless errors in the paper. All authors have agreed
that retraction from the literature is the appropriate solution to
correct the scientific record, and apologize to the Editorial Board
and readership of Carcinogenesis.

1.Introduction
The well-known “Riemann hypothesis” was left by the German mathematician
Georg F. B. Riemann (1826-1866). He observed that the distribution of prime
numbers among all natural numbers is very closely related to the behavior of an
infinite series:
∞ 1
ζ(s)=∑ , (1)
ns
n=1
which is usually called the Riemann Zeta function. Here s is a complex number
whose real part is usually denoted by Re(s) . If there is a s who satisfies
0
ζ(s )=0,
then we call it one zero point of
ζ(s)
. Just as stated by E. Bombieri
0
[1], this function has real zero points at the negative even integers −2,−4,
and one refers to them as the trivial zeros. Relatively, the other complex zero
DOI: 10.4236/am.2019.108049 Aug. 22, 2019 691 Applied MathematicsJ.L. Wang
points of it are called the nontrivial zeros.
Riemann hypothesis: All the nontrivial zeros of
ζ(s)
have real part
Re(s)=1 2.
Is it true? In 1986 the first 1.5 billion nontrivial zeros of
ζ(s)
(arranged by
increasing positive imaginary part) had been checked in [2], and the result
showed that they are simple and possess real part Re(s)=1 2 [1]. So the Rie-
mann hypothesis is very likely true. The proof of it had ever been a global hot
topic when British mathematician Michael F. Atiyah (1929-2019) reported his
D
findings in Heidelberg Laureate Forum on Sep. 24, 2018. Unfortunately, his ap-
proach does not work and the Riemann hypothesis is still an open problem. For
the achievements on this topic, one can referE to the reviews in [1] [3] [4] and the
related references. In the following, we focus our attention on illustrating the
useful terms for our proof.
T
In an epoch-making memoir published in 1859, Riemann introduced a trans-
formation for the Zeta function [1] [3]:
ξ(s)C=(s−1)π− 2s Γ s +1 ζ(s),
(2)
2 
where Γ is the gamma function defined by
A
Γ s +1 =∫+∞ t  2s +1  −1 e−tdt =∫+∞ t2s e−tdt
(3)
2  0 0
with propRerty Γ(s 2+1)=(s 2)Γ(s 2) . This transformation has three advan-
tages below [3]:
1) The zero points of
ξ(s)
coincide with the nontrivial zeros of
ζ(s)
;
T 2) In the complex plane , ξ(s) is analytic at any point s≠∞;
3) The later possesses the symmetric property
ξ(s)=ξ(1−s)
.
The first term indicates that,
ζ(s)
is equivalent to
ξ(s)
and the proof of
E
Riemann hypothesis only requires the fulfilment of Re(s)=1 2 for the zero
points of
ξ(s)
. The last two terms contains a lot of latent information which
R need to be interpreted. Fortunately, during this interpreting process we have
found the key to the door. For an analytic function, its real and imaginary parts
are all harmonic functions which satisfy the two-dimensional Laplace equations.
Hence, the Mean Formula and Extremum Principle for them can be exploited.
Meanwhile, the symmetric property of
ξ(s)
can be also converted to its real
and imaginary parts. To combine these beneficial tools it leads to a new ap-
proach. To follow this, the abstract complex analysis on
ζ(s)
is avoided, and
the proof is just an elementary one which is only associated with two bivariate
real functions.
Since for the case Re(s)>1 the modulus of ζ(s) satisfies ζ(s) >0 (the
proof is provided in [3]), there is no zero points for
ξ(s)
in the region
Re(s)>1.
Meanwhile, the symmetric property
ξ(s)=ξ(1−s)
indicates that
there is no zero points in the region
Re(s)<0,
either. So there is a natural set-
ting for the proof: All the zero points of
ξ(s)
, that is, all the nontrivial zeros of
DOI: 10.4236/am.2019.108049 692 Applied MathematicsJ.L. Wang
ζ(s)
lie in the strip bounded by
0≤Re(s)≤1.
Though there are some im-
provements on narrowing this strip, this original setting delimited by Riemann
is enough for our proof.
The proof is rigorous. During this process, the contradiction method is adopted,
and the symmetric property of
ξ(s)
, the Mean Formula and Extremum Principle
of harmonic functions play key parts.
2.Convert to a Real-Valued Problem
D
To split the real part and imaginary part of
ξ(s)
, the complex-valued problem
can be converted to a real-valued problem.
It follows from Equations (1)-(3) that E

Equation (4) is rewritten as

V =(x−1)(φv+ψu)+y(φu−ψv). (7)

One can check these with Equation (6) and Equation (7). There is a direct result

Let Ω be any finite two-dimensional domain in 2 . The analytic property
of ξ(s) implies good smoothness for U and V on Ω. So the second-order de-
rivatives of them exist and are continuous, that is, U,V∈C2(Ω). In addition,
U,V∈C0( Ω)
mean they are continuous on Ω together with its boundary
∂Ω. Here this request is naturally satisfied. Simple deduction from Equation (8)
results in:
U +U =0, V +V =0, (x,y)∈Ω. (10)

properties:
T
U(x,−y)=U(x,y), U(1−x,y)=U(x,y),
V(x,−y)=−V(x,y), V(1−x,y)=−V(x,y).

Proof. It follows from Equation (5) and Equation (6) that

=U(x,y).
In addition,
ξ(s)=ξ(1−s)
reads
U(x,y)+iV(x,y)=U(1−x,−y)+iV(1−x,−y)
,
which indicates that
U(x,y)=U(1−x,−y)
and
V(x,y)=V(1−x,−y)
. To
substitute x by 1−x in Equation (14) the relation also holds, that is,
U(1−x,−y)=U(1−x,y)
. Furthermore, to combine these two equations we get
U(x,y)=U(1−x,−y)=U(1−x,y)
. In the same way the relations for V are
proved to be true. The proof is finished.
For the particular cases y≡0 and x≡1 2, the relations for V read
DOI: 10.4236/am.2019.108049 694 Applied MathematicsJ. L. Wang
V(x,0)≡−V(x,0)
and
V(1 2,y)≡−V(1 2,y)
. So
V(x,0)≡V(1 2,y)≡0.
It
indicates ξ(x+iy) has 0 imaginary part on the lines y≡0 and x≡1 2. This
theorem can be understood as: U and V are symmetric and anti-symmetric
about the two lines y≡0 and x≡1 2, respectively. Particularly, due to the
direct relationship with the Riemann hypothesis, the line x≡1 2 has drawn
much attention. It owns a particular appellation “critical line” [4]. Relatively, the
value of the line y≡0 (which accords with the real axis) is usually ignored. Yet
the symmetric properties about it cannot be neglected. They are beneficial for
D
the proof.
As the real-valued problem concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is restated as:
Except on the critical line x≡1 2, U(x,y) and V(x,y) have no other mu-
E
tual zero point in 2. The proof will be done by a contradiction method.
3. The Proof of Riemann Hypothesis
T
Suppose there is a mutual zero point
( x*,y*)
for
U(x,y)
and
V(x,y)
(that
is,
U( x*,y*) =V( x*,y*)
=0) away from the critical line x≡1 2. In view of the
symmetric properties in
TheC
orem 1 together with the natural setting
0≤Re(s)≤1
for ξ(s) , without loss of generality we require 1 2<x* ≤1 and y* >0.
First of all, we say
( x*,y*)
can’t be an isolated zero point for
U(x,y)
or
A
V(x,y)
. On the contrary, if it is an isolated zero point for
V(x,y)
, to draw a
small disc O with its center at
( x*,y*)
, then the sign of
V(x,y)
maintains un-
changed on its boundary ∂O. Hence, the inner point
( x*,y*)
must be a mini-
R
mum point or a maximum point of
V(x,y)
on O which violates the Extremum
Principle. The same thing occurs for
U(x,y)
.
TNow that
( x*,y*)
is not an isolated zero point, there should be one or two con-
tinuous zero-valued lines across it. The case with two lines may occur if
( x*,y*)
is
a saddle point. In fact, since
U(x,y)
and
V(x,y)
are two-dimensional sur-
Efaces, these zero-valued lines are actually the intersected ones with the x-y
plane. It follows from Proposition 1 that the zero-valued lines for
U(x,y)
and
V(x,y)
differ from each other. Notice that the anti-symmetry is more favorable
R than the symmetry for the proof, the function V is stressed in our consideration.
Firstly we consider the variation of
V(x,y)
respect to the vertical anti-symmetric
axis x≡1 2. To draw a circle O with center
( x*,y*)
and radius R, then we see
that in case R> x*−1 2 it intersects with the line x≡1 2 and on the contrary
case it does not. Particularly, for the case R> x*−1 2 there exists a part D
L
of O to the left of this line (see Figure 1). Meanwhile, to the right of this line,
there is a symmetric area D which is also included in O (This area can be seen
R
as the part intersected by the critical line and another circle O′ with center
( 1−x*,y*)
and radius R). To get rid of D and D , the remainder C of disc
L R
O can be further divided into two symmetric parts, that is, the upper part C+
and lower part C−, respect to the horizontal line y≡ y*. Here the remainder C
is like the moon, it waxes for R≤ x*−1 2 and wanes for R> x*−1 2. For vi-
sualization we call this remainder by “the moon”. Particularly, the bigger the ra-
dius, the thinner the moon.

tions φ(x,R)= y*+ R2−( x−1+x*)2 and ψ(x,R)= y*+ R2−( x−x*)2 , the

Does the arbitrariness of radius R in Equation (19) imply
F(x,y)≡0?
It
seems true. A rigorous proof is needed.

given integral of the form
h(y)=∫b(y)
f (x,y)dx, D (20)
a(y)
where a(y) , b(y) and f (x,y) are all differentiable functions, its derivative
satisfies E

here φ(α(R),R)= y* and ψ( x*+R,R) = y* are used. It is easy to check from
Equation (22) and Equation (23) that the derivative of
Φ(R)
is continuous at
the point R=R .
0
Since for all positive R the equality
Φ(R)≡0
holds, its derivative should sa-
tisfy
Φ′(R)≡0.
We note here that the zero values of Equation (22) and Equa-
tion (23) can be obtained by the curvilinear integral form of Mean Formula in
Equation (11) in a direct way. However, if this form of Mean Formula is em-
ployed from the beginning, the deduction process is un-reducible either, since
D
the curvilinear integral is awkward in revealing the characteristics of the func-
tion
F(x,y)=V(x,y)+V( x,2y*−y)
. So the previous arguments on the sur-
face integral are necessary. Notice that oEnly for the case R>R
0
the an-
ti-asymmetric property of V(x,y) about the critical line x≡1 2 is employed,
in the following only Equation (23) is considered.
To denote the points

3.3. The Anti-Asymmetric Property of V about the Line y≡ y∗
EFor the function
F(x,y)=V(x,y)+V( x,2y*−y)
, it is easily checked that
F +F =0. So the Mean Formula and Extremum Principle also hold for
xx yy
F(x,y)
. Particularly,
( x*,y*)
is also a zero point of
F(x,y)
, since for this
R case F( x*,y*) =2V( x*,y*) =0 . The anti-asymmetric property of V(x,y)
about the critical line x≡1 2 passes on to F(x,y) , and this line is also a ze-
ro-valued one for it. In addition, since
F( x,2y*−y) =V( x,2y*−y) +V(x,y)=F(x,y)
,
the function F(x,y) is symmetric about the horizontal line y= y*.
We claim that the equality F(x,y)≡0 holds on any finite domain Ω. To
prove this it needs to rule out other possibilities. First of all, it follows from the
Extremum Principle that the point
( x*,y*)
is not an isolated zero point. The
case with a zero-valued patch at any location is not permitted either, since for
this situation there must be an extreme point in the interior of an arbitrary large
domain Ω which includes this patch, and it further leads to a contradictory
result
F(x,y)≡0.
Hence, the left possible cases are as follows: There is one or
two continuous zero-valued lines across the point
( x*,y*)
, and to one side of
DOI: 10.4236/am.2019.108049 699 Applied MathematicsJ. L. Wang
each branch (for one-line case and two-lines case there are 2 and 4 branches se-
parated by the point
( x*,y*)
, respectively) the values of
F(x,y)
have the
same sign. It only needs to show the impossibility of these cases.
Firstly, these zero-valued branches cannot intersect with the critical line
x≡1 2 or form a closed loop by themselves. In fact, if there exists a branch which
intersect with this line, there must be another one due to the symmetric property
of F(x,y) . For this case, these two branches together with the line x≡1 2
form a closed loop, and on the enclosed domain Ω the value of F(x,y) has
D
the same sign in the interior. Notice that F(x,y)=0 on the boundary ∂Ω,
there must be an extreme point in the interior, and this violates the Extremum
Principle. Similarly, it is impossible for theEse branches form a closed loop by
themselves, either.
To recall the symmetric property of
F(x,y)
, in addition to the particular case
with y≡ y*, there should be one Tpair or two pairs of symmetric zero-valued
branches as in Figure 2. For convenience of illustration, this particular case will be
considered in the last. Without loss of generality, we assume that the values of
F(x,y) possess positive Csign between x≡1 2 and the upper branch (when
there are two pairs, the one which is closer to the line x≡1 2 is chosen). For all
the cases, there is always a suitable radius R such that the circular arc
PM
(ex-
A
cept the point P) lies in this positive domain. The interval to be chosen for R is
given by 1 2<α(R)<x*, that is, R <R<2x*−1. In fact, only if R is suffi-
0
ciently close to R the above request is fulfilled. Notice that on this arc the
R0
point P is the unique zero point for F(x,y) , for a given small number δ>0,
there must be another small number ε>0 such that F( x,φ(x,R))≥ε on the
i Tnterval  1 2+δ,α(R) . Hence, it follows from Equation (25) that

For the case that the line y≡ y* is a zero-valued one, the above contradic-
tion still holds, nothing but another zero point M is added.
In a word, all the possibilities other than
F(x,y)=V(x,y)+V( x,2y*−y)
≡0
T
are excluded. Hence, on any finite domain Ω there is always an anti-symmetric
property for V: V( x,2y*−y) =−V(x,y) . Due to the arbitrariness of Ω, this
property should also hold inC 2. Particularly, on the anti-symmetric axis y≡ y*,
it reads
V( x,y*) =−V( x,y*)
which leads to
V( x,y*)
≡0. So the horizontal
line y≡ y* is a zero-valued one for V(x,y) across the concerned point
( x*,y*) . By the wAay, this anti-symmetric property for V(x,y) is a strong re-
sult. It implies that, in addition to y≡ y* and y≡0, there are infinitely many
horizontal zero-valued lines of V(x,y) with equal interval y*.
R
3.4. The Final Proof
Since the horizontal line y≡0 is also an anti-symmetric axis for V(x,y) , we
T
take
G(x,y)=V(x,y)+V( 2x*−x,y)
as the research object. Here we note that,
for this case, the zero-valued lines for
G(x,y)
differ from those for
F(x,y)
,
Eand the line x≡1 2 is not a zero-valued one for G(x,y) anymore. The simi-
lar deduction process as the previous respect to Figure 3 results in
G(x,y)≡0.
This indicates that the anti-symmetric property
V( 2x*−x,y) =−V(x,y)
holds
R for every (x,y)∈ 2. So the line x≡ x* is another zero-valued one for
V(x,y)
across the point
( x*,y*)
.
In all, if
( x*,y*)
is a mutual zero point for
U(x,y)
and
V(x,y)
, then
y≡ y* and x≡x* are all the zero-valued lines for V(x,y) across it. Hence,
it should be a saddle point for
V(x,y)
. Yet, for this case, the rectangular region
PQRS is enclosed by 4 segments of zero-valued lines (see Figure 3). In the inte-
rior of this region
V(x,y)
possesses the same sign, and there must be a mini-
mum point or maximum point, which violates the Extremum Principle. This
contradiction indicates that, it is impossible for the existence of mutual zero
point for U(x,y) and V(x,y) away from the critical line x≡1 2. In anoth-
er word, the function
ξ(s)=ξ(x+iy)=U(x,y)+iV(x,y)
only possesses zero
points for the case Re(s)=1 2. Furthermore, notice that the nontrivial zeros of
ζ(s)
coincide with the zero points of
ξ(s)
, all their real parts must also satis-
fy Re(s)=1 2. The proof of Riemann hypothesis is finished.

We note

that, in this contradiction proof the real part
U(x,y)
of
ξ(s)
is not
involved, and it has been solely finished by the imaginary part
V(x,y)
. This
means, no matter
U(x,y)
equals to zero or not,
V(x,y)
does not equal to

zero except on the critical line x≡1 2. This is a surprising result! Relative to the
original function
ζ(s)
, this good characteristic may owe to the symmetric
property of
ξ(s)
. It requires the imaginary part
V(x,y)
to be anti-symmetric
E
both about the vertical line x≡1 2 and about the horizontal line y≡0. In fact,
it is not strange. It follows from Equation (7) that
R V = (x−1)ψ+yφ u+ (x−1)φ−yψ v.
So ξ=U +iV differs from ζ=u+iv, and the imaginary part of ξ depends
not only on v but also on u. Particularly, u=v=0 accords with V =0.
Now that the Riemann hypothesis is proved, all the nontrivial zeros of
ζ(s)
are in the form s=1 2+it . Due to the symmetric property of ξ(s) about the
real axis, here only positive t is concerned. Though there are many numerical
approaches for solving these nontrivial zeros, the distribution characteristics of
them along the critical line are not clear. Is there a uniform explicit expression
for these imaginary parts? For s=1 2+it the infinite series:
η(s)=∑∞ (−1)n+1 1 =∑∞ (−1)n+1 n−1 2cos(tlnn)+i∑∞ (−1)n n−1 2sin(tlnn),
(26)
ns
n=1 n=1 n=1
is convergent, and it is easily checked that
η(s)=( 1−21−s) ζ(s)
. Notice that
1−21−s ≠0 for this case, the nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) can be calculated by

η(s)=0 . Let + be the set of positive integers. For a fixed t, though
sin(tlnz)
and
cos(tlnz)
have some kind of periodicity about z on
(0,∞)
,
that is, f ( e2kπtz) = f (z) for some k∈ +, when the real number z is substi-
tuted by n∈ +, this periodicity is not necessarily sustained. Particularly, if
there exists a m∈ + such that 2kπ t =lnm, then the periodicity of the form
f (mn)= f (n) is met. On the contrary, if the inequality 2kπ t ≠lnm holds
for all k,m∈ +, then the terms of the series vary in a chaotic manner respect to
n, and it may be in vain for pinning one’s hope on that the two sums of infinite
D
series in Equation (26) converge to 0 simultaneously. Enlightened by this, we
give an extended version of “Riemann hypothesis” below:
Riemann-Wang hypothesis: The nontrivEial zeros of
ζ(s)
possess same real
part σ=1 2 and different imaginary parts which satisfy a uniform explicit ex-
pression:

t = , k,m∈ +.
lnm
Here the statement about the real part is proved, and the one about the im-
C
aginary part is open.
In addition to this research, we had also done some exploring on another
well-known problAem named “P versus NP” in [6], where a surprising result “P =
NP” was proved. One can also comment on it.

TOMASZ KOWALSKI
In this journal I published a paper [1 ] entitled ""PDL has interpolation"" purporting
to prove what the title announced. It has been pointed out to me by Yde Venema
that my argument contains a serious error. As I have not been able to correct it, the
problem of interpolation for Propositional Dynamic Logic is still open.

core samples collected between 2006 and 2015 to estimate food availability. We used species-specific 24-h time–
activity data collected between 2011 and 2013 to estimate daily energy expenditure, morphometrically corrected for
site- and day-specific thermoregulatory costs. To estimate population-level energy demand, we used standardized
monthly ground surveys (2005–2014) to create a migration curve, and proportionally scaled that to fit aerial survey
data (2005–2014). Crucially, we also explicitly incorporated estimates of variance in all of these parameters and

outlier-removed, a strict depletion model indicated that at estimated mean levels of supply (923 million kcal) and
cumulative demand (3.4 billion kcal), refuge food resources were depleted before November. However, a constant-
supply model that represented tidal replenishment of resources indicated that just enough energy was present to
sustain peak winter populations. Variation in model output appeared to be driven primarily by uncertainty in
population abundance during peak periods of use, emphasizing a new management focus on studying migration
chronologies of waterfowl. This model allows for relative assessment of biases and uncertainties in carrying-capacity
modeling, and serves as a framework identifying critical science needs to improve local and regional waterfowl
management planning.

Vol. 160, No. 6, March 17, 2003. Pages 899–908.
The authors retract the above-referenced manuscript on the basis of the fact that one of the major conclusions, regard-
ing the function of paramyosin in myoblast fusion, is incorrect. The authors stand by all of the other data with the ex-
ception of one correction. See below for details.
In this paper, a myoblast fusion defect was attributed to mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster paramyosin
gene. We now show that the fusion defect instead apparently arises from the TM3 balancer chromosome. Experiments
subsequent to publication using a TM3-containing line that lacked a paramyosin mutation suggested that we had mis-
identified balancer chromosome–containing individuals before the late embryonic stage as paramyosin mutant ho-
mozygotes (prm1/prm1). By using a lacZ-expressing version of TM3, staining experiments unambiguously identified
young prm1 homozygotes and showed them all to lack the fusion defect, implying that the fusion defect is due to the
presence of the TM3 chromosome. We have not tested whether this is a homozygous or heterozygous effect of TM3.
The apparent rescue of the fusion defect by the wild-type paramyosin transgene is presumably due to the absence of the
TM3 chromosome, instead of the presence of the paramyosin transgene. We conclude that embryos identified as prm1
homozygotes in Figs. 3 and 4 of the paper, as well as on the cover of the journal, are not of this genotype. We thus re-
tract the conclusion that paramyosin is important for myoblast fusion. In contrast, prm1/prm1 late-stage embryos and
larvae were unambiguously identified by mouth hook color, and so our conclusion regarding myofibril defects in prm1
homozygotes remains valid.
As a result of a PCR artifact and an error in notation, the deletion in the prm1 allele was stated to be 4 kb in size.
Reanalysis of the data as well as additional cloning and sequencing indicate that the deletion is actually 1.05 kb in
length and is internal to the P element. The deleted region encompasses portions of the upstream region and first exon
of the white(cid:1) gene, removing 163 codons. Thus, the paramyosin coding region itself is not disrupted in either prm1 or
its parent line and both contain a P element insert in the transcribed, but not translated, region of prm exon 1. Since the
normal prm transcription start site is upstream of the P element, prm transcripts likely are produced by transcription
from the element into the prm coding region or by use of a cryptic transcription start site in the 174 bp between the in-
sertion site and the coding region. Internal deletion of a portion of the P element in prm1 may reduce transcriptional
read through or initiation, accounting for reduced expression compared with its parent line. Some internally deleted P
elements have stronger mutant phenotypes than their undeleted parental element (Staveley et al., 1995; Hodgetts and
O’Keefe, 2001).
The authors stand by the data as to the location of the P element disrupting the paramyosin gene (Fig. 1), the effects
of prm1 and rescue on paramyosin and miniparamyosin expression (Fig. 2), the expression pattern detected by the anti-
paramyosin antibody (Figs. 5 and 6), the myofibrillar defects found in prm1 homozygotes and the rescue of these defects
(Figs. 7, 8, and 9). However, the editors require retraction of the entire paper, and it is consequently marked as such.
The authors sincerely regret these errors and appreciate the opportunity to correct them. We are indebted to Qin
Yu, William Kronert, and Jennifer Suggs (San Diego State University, San Diego, CA) for their insights and for carry-
ing out the experiments reported here.

4 DiscussionandConclusion
We have studied the nucleotide compositions of the target (mRNA) and the query
(lncRNA) sequences in order to find out the sequence-based features within them
which will have an effect on target binding. We have also tried to discriminate
betweenthembaseduponthefeaturesusingmachinelearningmodel[18].Fromthis
analysis,itisconcludedthatnucleotidecomposition-basedfeatureisnotenoughfor280 D.SharmaandG.Meena

Hydrophilic hybrid materials with magnetism & NIR fluorescence via surface-initiated RAFT
polymerization
Weiwei He, Lifen Zhang, Bing Han, Liang Cheng, Nianchen Zhou, Zhuang Liu and Zhenping Cheng
J. Mater. Chem. B, 2013, 1 (26), 3257–3266 (DOI: 10.1039/c3tb20262c). Retraction published 24
September 2013
We, the named authors, hereby wholly retract this Journal of Materials Chemistry B article due to the
subsequent realisation that fluorescence measurements reported in the article should have been measured
through a long-pass filter. The emission at 750 nm reported from the excitation of the monomer 1-(4-vinyl
benzyl)-2-naphthyl-benzimidazole by UV light, is actually a second order diffraction artefact of the 380 nm
emission. The claim that the monomer is capable of emitting near infrared fluorescence under UV light
excitation in the article is false.

these core–shell hybrid NPs (55.89 emu g(cid:2)1, Fig. 9(a)), can be

graed NPs (Fig. 13(c)) aer chain-extension was also lower

Aided by the silica shell and PPEGMA chains, the NPs also
possess comparative stability when dispersed in water. The

to Fig. 13(a)–(c), all the uorescence intensities are reduced

We, the named authors, hereby wholly retract this Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics article. After publication, we found a
mistake in the data analysis, which originated from an honest error made during preparation of the article. In particular, the
numberoftransferredelectronsnisreciprocal,i.e.0.85forthefirstand0.33forthesecondtransition.Furthermore,themid-point
potentialofhemeainCO-boundcytochromecoxidasehasbeenderivedfromthechangeinintensityofavibrationalbandofthe
IR spectrum whose assignment is ambiguous. Thus, our conclusions relating to electron-coupled proton transfer involving the
hemecofactorsareflawed.
Theauthorswouldliketoapologizeforanyinconveniencetoreaders.

Aims Whether a loading dose of atorvastatin (80mg) can reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in
patientswithacutecoronarysyndrome(ACS)remainscontroversial.Therefore,weperformedthismeta-analysis.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
R
Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing a loading dose of atorvastatin to a control in patients with ACS
andresults who underwent PCI were identified through searches of medical literature databases. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare the primary endpoint. Finally, 13 trials enrolling 22 095
patients were included; of the 22 095 patients, 11 214 (50.7%) received loading doses of 80mg of atorvastatin.
Compared with the control, atorvastatin significantly reduced MACE (RR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.54–0.80), myocardial in-
farction(MI;RR:0.61,95%CI0.46–0.80),revascularization(RR:0.76,95%CI0.69–0.83),andstroke(RR:0.69,95%
CI0.49–0T.96).Therewasnodifferenceindeathorrehospitalizationbetweenthetwogroups.Inthesubgroupana-
lysis, atorvastatin still significantly reduced MACE (RR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.39–0.85) and MI (RR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.42–
0.89) within 30days. Furthermore, atorvastatin still remarkably reduced MACE (RR: 0.70, 95% CI 0.55–0.89), MI
(RR: 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.95), and revascularization (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.69–0.84) after more than 30days. No sig-
nificantdifferenceswereobservedindeathorstrokewithin30daysoraftermorethan30days.

Retraction of ‘G-quadruplex structural transition
driven by a platinum compound’
Nucleic Acids Research , Volume 50, Issue 14, 12 August 2022, Pages 7816–7828, https: // doi.org / 10.1093 / nar / gkac572
At the request of the authors, Nucleic Acids Research is retracting ‘G-quadruplex structural transition driv e n by a platinum
compound’ by Wenting Liu, Bo-Chen Zhu, Liu-Yi Liu, Xiao-Yu Xia, and Zong-Wan Mao.
The authors mis-interpreted the NMR data and corresponding assignments of resonances. The binding ev e nt that lies at
the core of the study (Pt-phen to c-MYC G-quadruplex) does not appear to drive the magnitude of conformational change
that the authors had modelled and described. Howev e r, the authors confirm that the underlying data is correct, including
the fact that the platinum compound Pt-phen interacts with c-MYC G-quadruplex through dynamic binding pathways in
high and low K + conditions. The cellular results and biological function regulations also remain valid. Unfortunately, the
peak overlap and H relaxation in 2D 1 H NMR data may lead to erroneous analysis results.
The Editors commend the authors for being forthcoming and disclosing these concerns.

The article “Stratifying Future Stroke Risk with Incidentally Discovered White Matter

mer, David F. Kallmes, Jason Nelson, Sunyang Fu, Chengyi Zheng, Hongfang Liu, Wansu
Chen, and David M. Kent has been retracted by the Publishers and the Editor on behalf
of the authors.
After the publication of this article, the authors identified a discrepancy when compar-
ing the results from this analysis to those of other analyses. The authors found that the
inclusion of a gender=other value led to issues with multiple imputations where the im-
putation model did not converge. The authors stated that this type of error is easy to detect
as warning messages appear as part of the programming logs. However, as they iterative-
ly ran a macro to handle 10 imputed datasets, the warning message was suppressed.
The authors reanalyzed the data and found that the hazard ratios in Table 1 were al-
tered, and the Editor concluded that the results were altered and an Erratum would not
be appropriate to correct the error. The authors present the reanalyzed and interpreted
results in a new publication (Wang et al., Cerebrovasc Dis 2023, https://doi.
org/10.1159/000534581).

Abstract
T
Combining with field experiments in Ivy Town residential area, numerical simulation of the influ-
ences of vegetation on outdoor wind environment with SPOTE (Simulation Platform for Outdoor
Thermal Environment) was carried out for comparison in the study. The conclusions were drawn
E
as follows: 1) the wind velocity with and without vegetation was compared both in winter and
summer; the simulation results would help us determine which vegetation to plant in green space;
2) after supplanting the status deciduous vegetation into evergreen one, the actual wind velocity
R
increased to a much extent in areas with adjusting vegetation than areas with status vegetation,
with an increase by 64.7% in winter; 3) by adjusting arrangement and types of vegetation in the
regions where the wind environment was unpleasant for pedestrian thermal comfort both in win-
ter and summer, the pedestrian-level wind velocity could be obviously improved through the si-
mulation and comparison.

tion has become markedly worse in recent years in Beijing. One of the intensities of urban heat island of Beijing
that has gradually increased is the loss of vegetative cover in urban areas [1]. In order to reduce the UHI effects,
various mitigating measures have been proposed. The most commonly applied measures include tree planting
[2]. However, the monetary benefits of urban trees are difficult to qualify because these trees can provide nu-
merous benefits, such as improving thermal environment, reducing community noise and air pollution problems,
enhancing biodiversity and meliorating aesthetics [3] [4]. Thus, residential green space, which is one of urban
reforestation styles, is of interest, and the greening and beautification of residential quarter has become one of
the main concerns of residents [5].
Wind environment is one of the most important factors to be considered in UHI study as it has significant in-
D
fluence on UHI effect and outdoor thermal comfort [6]. The conventional urban wind environment assessment
methods only took into consideration on improving the outdoor thermal environment by changing the arrange-
ment of the building and building coverage ratio for a given background [7]. However, from engineering point
of view, the existence of tree covered ground surface is one of the most essentiaEl factors to be considered in ur-
ban design, and using vegetation to improve a residential area’s microclimate has been investigated by a few re-
searches [8] [9]. It has been found on average that about 80% of the cooling effect in hot and humid climate re-
gions is contributed by vegetation shading [10] [11]. In addition, vegetation would decrease the upstream wind
T
velocity obviously [12].
Despite the import influence of vegetation for thermal environment in residential areas, the current vegetation
design only considers visual requirements, and the current Chinese National Residential Greening Norms and
C
Beijing Residential Greening Norms have no quantitative measures for planting to create comfortable thermal
environment [13], and the arrangements of vegetation are actually often made empirically from the varying
standpoints of conventional planning concepts for landscape design. Furthermore, a typical problem for residen-
tial quarters in Beijing is that hot summer and cold winter are impacted by monsoon climate, and the outdoor
A
thermal environment has various problems in both summer and winter respectively [14]. Although some re-
searchers have been conducted into the effect of landscape on wind environment in residential area [12], few
reports have systematically quantified the relationship between vegetation and wind environment in residential
areas in terms of quantitatively optimal Rdesign of vegetation to create a pleasant outdoor thermal environment.
Combining field experimental tests with numerical studies by Simulation Platform for Outdoor Thermal En-
vironment (SPOTE) [15], this study investigated the optimal design of vegetation to develop the optimal design
method for a pleasant outdoor thermal environment, and the optimal design of vegetation was examined for im-
T
proved ventilation in summer whilst checking any flow of cold wind in winter by means of the optimal design
method presented in this research.
2. MethodologEy
2.1. Research Method
Figure 1 Rshows the flow of the optimal vegetation design system for improving wind environment in residential
areas using numerical modeling and field experiment. As presented by the author, this optimum design system
was composed of the following four stages: Initially, an optimization problem was established by the designer;

next, numerical analysis was performed on the outdoor wind environment using SPOTE simulation; thirdly, by
consistency of model simulation and experimental testing, the influences of different vegetation on wind envi-
ronment were investigated. Finally, the optimum solution candidates and the optimum process were examined.
Hence, as the first step, the design objective and evaluation method were determined in these stage. In the
second stage, models including plants and buildings were used to analyze the outdoor environment. In the third
stage, in order to investigate influence of different vegetation on wind filed, numerical simulations were carried
out to determine which vegetation to plant in green space in that we can predict the effects of vegetation on wind
environment. In the fourth stage, optimal design of vegetation was examined for improved ventilation in sum-
mer whilst checking any flow of cold wind in winter. Thus far, the optimal vegetation design for comfortable
D
wind environment was carried out.
2.2. Field Experiment
E
Ivy town residential area is located at northeast part of Chaoyang district, Beijing (Figure 2). With an area of
6.38 million square meters, buildings are distributed in rows. The vegetation in the green space between build-
ings is presented the following characteristics: 1) Trees are low with a height no more than 3 m; 2) The smaller
number of evergreen trees are planted in the green space. This is suiTtable for comparison research, for it can
better reflect the impact of vegetation on wind environment by numerical simulation.
Portable weather stations were used in this study to measure the parameters including wind velocity (mea-
surement accuracy: 0.1 m/s, measurement range: 0 - 70 m/s, Cmeasurement error: ±(0.3% + 3% of reading) m/s)
and wind direction (measurement accuracy: 1˚, measurement range: 0˚ - 360˚, measurement error: ±3˚), as well
as air temperature and humidity.
With consideration of attenuation effect of vegetation on wind velocity and the location of concentrated open
A
activity areas for residents, a total of 8 measuring points were installed for studying the impact of air flow on the
daily activities of local residents. Meanwhile, the attenuation effect of different vegetation types and arrange-
ment on wind velocity could also be investigated (Figure 3).
Testing time was May 19, 2011, and dominant wind direction was SW with 3 - 4 m/s velocity. Measurement
R
parameters included wind velocity, wind direction and temperature with a 1 minute sample frequency. The val-
ues were taken for several times with the average value obtained in the stable wind field.
2.3. Numerical SimulatiTon Study

vironment including proper vegetation and building model. In this study, SPOTE, consisting of an air model, ve-
getation model, underlying surface model and a general radiation calculation model, was chosen for numerical
simulation, and coupled calculation of radiation, convection, conduction and air flow were carried out considering
T
vegetation influences. The details of sub-models of SPOTE are introduced as below.
2.3.1. Air Model
E
A standard k-ε model is employed by applying extra terms in the flow, momentum, and energy equations for the
aerodynamic effects of vegetation. The drag force of vegetation canopy is presented with a term F added in the i
i
component of momentum equation, as well as F and F added into the transport equations of turbulent energy (k)
k ε
and energRy dissipation rate (ε), respectively, for denoting the effects on turbulent flow field. F, F, and F are de-
i k ε
rived by applying the spatial average to the basic equations.

where C is the drag coefficient; η is the green coverage ratio, and a is the leaf area density [m2∙m−3]. By com-
d
paring the numerical results with field measurements, the model coefficients C and C are respectively de-
pε1 pε2
fined as 1.8 and 0.6 [16].
Moreover, the functions of vegetation on temperature and humidity are applied using the following equation:

The transportation of radiation including solar and long-wave radiation among vegetation canopy and around
surfaces is calculated with a generalized radiation simulation system using the Monte-Carlo method, in which
the non-transparent objects and half-transparent objects are processed with 2D and 3D basic units respectively
T
for calculating the decay of emitted tracer ray [15]. Considering the symmetrization rule of radiation for the
calculation of DEA (Direct Exchange Area), TEA (Total Exchange Area) can be obtained by Geb-Hart method
[18]. So, the radiative heat transportation from one grid to another in a grey space can be easily computed. The
short wave (solar raEdiation) and long wave radiant fluxes incident to the plant canopy are calculated with a de-
cay exponential function respectively as exp(‒lka), where k is the absorption coefficient for long-wave and short
wave and l is the length by which radiant flux passes through the plant canopy.

the building envelope surfaces and from exterior surface to indoor space.
Because the thermal inertia of all underlying surfaces is very large, a 24 h iterative computation and an impli-

cit expression difference method are utilized respectively in this sub-model.
2.4. Numerical Simulation Study
The present authors carried out a series of numerical studies to examine the accuracy of simulation of wind field
using SPOTE [19]. In order to further verify the accuracy of numerical modeling in the study site, field mea-
surement data combining with incoming air velocity and numerical simulation were carried out with SPOTE.
Parameters adopted in this numerical modeling were as follows: vegetation was divided into the following
four categories according to height, leaf density and effects on pedestrian. Typical vegetation and final leaf area
index for each kind of vegetation are listed in Table 1. The standard k-ε turbulence model anDd incoming gradient
wind are regarded as boundary conditions. Other simulation settings were implemented with the AIJ guidance
[20]. The average wind velocity of each point was calculated and compared with the experimental data.
The measured data were consistent well with the simulation results, especially well for the wind direction of
E
each measuring point (Figure 4). Through comparison of the deviation between wind velocity in simulation and
experiment, it is discovered that the deviation between experimental and simulation results ranges from 2.35%
to 15.12% (Table 2). The following factors should be comprehensively considered: the deviation between vege-
tation model and actual experiment, errors caused by instrumental meaTsurement and systematic errors. With all
these factors considered, it could be concluded that simulated values represent well with those measured in ac-
tual experiment.

3.2. Comparison of Simulations by Adjusting the Types of Vegetation
The status vegetation in green space between buildings was mostly deciduous plants, and evergreen plants
composed a proportion no more than 10%. By adjusting the types of vegetation, in other words, supplant the
status deciduous plants into evergreen plants, the simulations after adjusting the types of vegetation were per-
formed (Figure 7).
Similarity, defining minus = V /V , the data of simulations after adjusting the types
[adjusting vegetation] [status vegetation]
of vegetation were compared (Figure 8), analysis for the wind environment at pedestrian level was carried out.
After supplanting the status deciduous plants into evergreen ones, the actual wind velocity increased to a
much extent in areas with adjusting vegetation than area with status vegetation, and the ratio of region with in-
creased wind velocity reaches almost 69.1% and 64.7% in summer and winter respectively, while regions with
excessively large wind velocity increased obviously in winter, due to the wind-induced effect of vegetation
(Table 4). It may be indicated that with all evergreen vegetation planted in the green space between buildings
would not improve the wind environment of residential areas, especially in winter. Therefore, the overall ever-
green vegetation may exert potential negative impact on building sunshine in winter [21].

Most of heights of tree crown were no more than 3 m, and the vast majority of vegetation was deciduous plants
in the study object. When coming wind velocity was too great, the wind environment inside the residential area
would be severely affected. Based on the accuracy of simulation of wind field using SPOTE in the study site,
appropriate adjustments could be made to mitigate the adverse impact of excessively great wind velocity on pe-
destrians. By optimizing the vegetation types and arrangement in the residential area, the simulations of wind

field distribution were carried out (Figure 9).
In accordance with the definition of minus, the data of simulations after and before optimum arrangement of
vegetation were compared independently (Figure 10).
After optimization of vegetation on the site, under identical simulation boundary conditions, the wind velocity
was decreased, and the ration of region with reduced wind velocity was 71.3% in winter (Table 5). It is betrayed
that evergreen vegetation, such as Sabina chinensis and Picea asperata, planted in the west-north side of the
residential, with an arrangement of arbor and bush, would effectively block the coming wind velocity and im-
prove the outdoor environment in winter. Moreover, trees planted in the passages between buildings could also
reduce the wind velocity.
Although the trade-off between wind environment in summer and winter was insufficient to specify, while the
comfortable of outdoor environment in winter was more important for pedestrian’s pleasantness in Beijing area
(Hong et al., 2011). The optimum arrangement of vegetation was regarded as the optimum design with a reduc-
tion of wind velocity by 61.6% in winter (Table 6).

that simulation results were consistent well with experiment data, and the wind field distribution could be accu-

without vegetation with a good improvement of more than 60%; 3) after supplanting the status deciduous vege-

adjusting arrangement and types of vegetation in the regions with excessively large wind velocity, the pede-
strian-level wind velocity could be obviously improved through the simulation and comparison, and the ration of
region with reduced wind velocity was 71.3% in winter.
This study analyzed the impacts of vegetation on outdoor wind environment with the specific wind velocity
and direction in the typical winter climate in Beijing, and put forward the optimization method of vegetation ar-
rangement. But the actual climatic conditions in Beijing are worse compared with the daily parameters em-
ployed in this simulation. If the prevailing wind direction and velocity change, more numerical simulations
should be carried out in the further research. Nevertheless, the results of this study can provide effective guid-

doi:10.1130/B31543.1 (published online 27 January 2017).
GSA Bulletin received the following information on 2 March 2017.
It has recently come to our attention that there is a calculation error in our paper, “Background rates of
erosion and sediment generation in the Potomac River basin, USA, derived using in situ 10Be, meteoric
10Be, and 9Be.”
The error was introduced during our calculation of sediment generation rates (D) from measurements of
meteoric 10Be(10Be ) and the reactive phase of 9Be(9Be ) in Equation 1 of our paper. We misunderstood
m reac
the original derivation of this equation in von Blanckenburg et al. (2012) and applied it incorrectly to our
study. Thus, all 10Be /9Be -derived sediment generation rates (and only the 10Be /9Be -derived sediment
m reac m reac
generation rates) presented in our paper are incorrect, as are the results of any statistical tests in which these
sediment generation data were used; this error affects Figures 3, 6, 7, 8, and 11 and Tables 1 and S3, which
graphically show and tabulate these data, respectively. We believe all other calculations are correct.
The errors associated with the incorrect 10Be /9Be -derived sediment generation rates are pervasive
m reac
throughout the paper. We are retracting the paper in its current form so as not to proliferate incorrect data or
to introduce misconceptions about how vonBlanckenburg et al.’s (2012) study should be applied elsewhere.
We regret any inconveniences this may cause.

a Grubb’s outlier test to identify statistical out- liers, which we investigated further to determine
if these samples were collected from severely
disturbed basins. Although both samples POT20
and POT45 were identified as outliers, we only
exclude POT20 from further analyses because
it drains a large portion of agricultural research

increased sediment generation; furthermore,
there is no certainty that all sediment derived

Appalachian Plateau provide evidence for long-term relief growth, but
not in the Valley and Ridge or Blue Ridge Provinces, where outcrop and
basin-averaged erosion rates overlap within 1σ uncertainties. Bedrock
data for the Appalachian Plateau come from Hancock and Kirwan (2007),
Portenga et al. (2013), and Reuter (2005); bedrock data for the Valley and
Ridge come from Duxbury et al. (2015) and Portenga et al. (2013); bed-
rock data for the Blue Ridge come from Duxbury et al. (2015), Hancock
et al. (2015), and Portenga et al. (2013). Basin-averaged data for the Appa-
lachian Plateau come from this study; basin-averaged data for the Valley
and Ridge and Blue Ridge come from this study and Duxbury et al. (2015).

velopment have increased worldwide in the last two decades, with a significant
proportion of this activity found in sub-Saharan Africa. The nature of land ac-
quisitions in Africa has been divergent; some acquisitions are through bilateral
arrangements; some are a result of individual purchases; while others are ille-
gitimately processed without the knowledge of bonafide owners and occupants
[1]. As a number of African countries have confirmed viable commercial quanti-
ties of oil, there has been shifted from exploration to commercial production in
D
the last 10 years, with a consequence of intensifying land acquisitions in the
oil-rich areas [2]. Over the last 10 years, between 51 and 63 million hectares are
currently involved in land deals or are under negotiation in 27 African host
E
countries [1]. Land acquisitions in most of these countries including Uganda are
driven by speculation and targeted focus on net benefits that will accrue from
government compensations [3].
T
In Uganda, loss of land in a space of less than five years has triggered a wave
of human migration movements in the Albertine Graben area, with some evicted
households concentrating in camps while others have moved to other locations
C
[4]. Households lost land that was a sole source of production, and their major
source of income from crops and animals as a result of the eviction process.
Households must adapt and make dynamic changes to meet their short-term
A
and long-term needs wherever they resettle. It is anticipated that households will
experience behavioural responses to lack of land and result in higher human
population density [5]. This dynamic change will require a significant increase in
R
production per unit of land and shift labour into non-farm activities by way of
diversification [6]. What is apparent is that there isn’t enough land where eve-
ryone can settle, no extensional support to double production, nor is there an
T
adequate source of relieved support to evictees [7]. It is therefore important to
draw lessons from local strategies households employ to cope with the eviction
shock, and what determines their buffer capacity and self re-organization to
E
adapt to changes.
Resilience here indicates the ability to anticipate, absorb, accommodate or re-
cover from disasters in a timely, efficient and sustainable manner. Strategies in-
R
clude protecting, restoring and improving food and agricultural systems under
threats that impact food and nutrition security, agriculture, and food
safety/public health [8]. However, there is ongoing debate surrounding the use
of resilience, mainly used in describing food security, and some scientists claim
that the term is inherently too conservative to be usefully applied to other situa-
tions in which more radical and broad social change is required.
This research seeks to answer the following questions:
1) Which livelihoods and resettlement typologies would enhance resilience
and which would lead to greater vulnerability?
2) What influences the ability of households to adapt to change?
3) Why do some households recover better and more quickly than others?
For many individuals and communities experiencing evictions, resilience
means becoming more proficient at preventing immediate impacts, recovering
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.79033 444 Open Journal of Applied SciencesJ. Ssekandi et al.
from the shock, rebuilding new lives, and overcoming multiple stresses. This
study evaluated the factors that influence the ability of households to withstand
eviction shock and then to recover under these unfortunate circumstances.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Area
The study area is located in the northern part of the Western RDegion of Uganda
(see Figure 1); it is an ecological hotspot as well as a developing source of oil.
Hoima District consists of 2 counties with 11 sub-counties and 2 town councils,
geographical coordinates 01˚25'N 31˚05'E, land area 3664.1 km2 (1414.7 sq mi),
E
with a population of 548,800 and density of 149.8/km2 (388/mi2). Buliisa district
consists of two sub counties and one town council, coordinates 02˚11'N 31˚24'E,
land area 2498.3 km2 (964.6 sq mi), humTan population 80,800, and density of
32.3/km2 (84/mi2). People were either pastoralists, agro-pastoralists or subsis-
tence agriculturalists before the evictions. Land disputes in this region have be-
come more common since thCe discovery of more 3.5 billion barrels of oil.
Within the last 10 years, over 25,000 people have been evicted from their lands,
causing displacement, loss of livelihood, land dispossession, loss of land-
scape/sense of place,A and loss of traditional knowledge/practices/cultures. Many

of the evictees are still living in pseudo camps within the districts; it remains
uncertain whether they will be allowed to stay and for how long. Loss of land
means loss of their own capacity to provide families with food. Well-intentioned
promises of compensation and resettlement have not been fulfilled, and it ap-
pears that so far no efforts were or are being made to build capacity to enhance
food production and recovery.
2.2. Data Collection D
A socio economic survey was administered to 372 evictees out of a total popula-
tion of 7191 evicted households. All respondents were purposively selected for
E
the study; all of these were from randomly selected villages without any attempt
to bias the selection. The main tools for quantitative data collection were house-
hold questionnaires, Focus Group Discussion (FGD), and Key Informants in-
T
cluding local government officials who played a major role in the resettlement
project and were contacted by phone and email and invited to participate in the
research. A focus group discusCsion was conducted on 24 April 2014 with four
local councils and three leaders in Buliisa including the Chairman, Chief Ad-
ministrative Officer, Community Development Officer, and Secretary for Pro-
duction. Following tAhe FGD, further field observations were undertaken in the
resettlement areas where the researcher spent time with people understanding
day-to-day livelihood struggles. Socioeconomic data were used to estimate resil-
ience using a two-stage factor analysis. In the first stage an index for each com-
R
ponent is calculated using an iterated principal factor method over a set of ob-
served variables. In the second stage, the resilience index is derived using the
sum of the factor analysis to get a value for each variable. Resilience index is a
T
weighted sum of the factors generated using Bartlett’s (1937) scoring method.
The empirical strategy followed a three-step procedure: 1) identification and
E measurement of the variables selected for each resilience indicator; 2) estimation
of the latent variable representing each indicator, and of the resilience index us-
ing factor analysis and principal components analysis; and 3) application of
R
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to estimate precise splitting rules
based on a regression tree, to improve understanding of the whole process.
2.3. Empirical Model
The revised FAO Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) model
was used to explain why one household returns to a desired level while a similar
household does not. The model explains the interaction between shocks and
their effects on households. The model assumes that the probability of suffering
from a shock due to a particular set of household characteristics is determined
by each household’s livelihood. Resilience to land eviction is assumed to depend
on the options available to households within the community to make a living.
This approach was initially applied to assess resilience to food security in which
resilience was measured as a latent variable defined by income and food access
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.79033 446 Open Journal of Applied SciencesJ. Ssekandi et al.
(IFA), assets (A), access to public services (APS), social safety-nets (SSN), stabil-
ity (S), and adaptive capacity (AC); this is illustrated in Equation (1) below:
R = f (IFA,S ,APS ,SNN ,S ,AC ) (1)
i i i i i i i
Since this study was about resilience to land eviction, more valuables were
added to the RIMA model that we considered relevant, and this helped to ensure
a more inclusive and robust analysis. The additional factors included are land
tenure regimes (TR), Physical Assets (PA), and Resettlement ODption (RO). The
adjusted model becomes:
R = f (SNN ,APS ,PA,IFA,TRS ,AC,RO ) (2)
i i i i i i i i
E
The rationale behind this model is that each household is characterized by a
number of characteristics that contribute to its recovery from the shock. How
well an individual household recovers or not is a function of the outcomes from
T
decisions taken and options available. Factor Scores were then combined into an
index which gives an overall quantitative resilience score; these were presented
by livelihood option. C
Estimation procedure
The empirical strategy follows a three-step procedure: 1) identification and
measurement of the Avariables selected for each resilience indicator; 2) estimation
of the latent variable representing each indicator, and of the resilience index us-
ing factor analysis and principal components analysis; and 3) application of
CART methodology to estimate precise splitting rules based on a regression tree,
R
to improve understanding of the whole process. Below is how variables were de-
termined.
a) Income and food access (IFA)
T
This component was computed from three indicators:
1) Per person daily income (PPDI) was computed from the estimation of daily
E income of the household after eviction;
2) Per person daily expenditure (PPDE) was computed from the estimation of
daily household expenditure after eviction;
R
3) Household food security and access score (HFIAS) was computed from a
number of days a household had not less than 2 meals per day.
b) Social safety nets (SSN)
Social safety nets are crucial for all evictees especially during the transition
from the onset of eviction to final resettlement destination in absence of any
formal support system. This component was computed from three indicators at
the time of or immediately following eviction:
1) Amount of cash and in kind assistance (AC&IKA) in monetary terms from
relatives or close friends for the period after eviction;
2) Frequency of assistance (FA) was used to estimate the number of times a
household received assistance in any form, whether weekly, monthly or annu-
ally;

household settled around an extended family and whether the extended family
offered any support after eviction.
c) Access to public services (APS)
This was measured by how far must people in a household walk to a health fa-
cility, school, church, public road and water source.
d) Adaptive capacity (AC)
This was used to estimate the importance of several demographic factors:
D
1) Income diversity (ID) was the number representing income generating
sources (e.g. a mixture of crop and livestock production);
2) Average education (AE) was the mean of the years of education completed
E
by the household’s members;
3) Employment ratio (ER) was calculated as the ratio between the number of
people in the household making a contribution (grazing, farming, fetching wood
T
and water among other contributions) and the household size.
e) Physical assets (PA)
This meant that a strong assets base is important for collateral security for ru-
C
ral people to restore and strengthen their livelihoods and their abilities to with-
stand and quickly recover from shocks, and was computed from:
1) Housing (H) was defined as a roofed shelter with capacity for people stay
A
there;
2) Durable index (DI) was obtained by summing up all the various physical
assets (plough, bicycle, radio, TV, pack animals);
R
3) Tropical livestock units (TLU) includes those owned by the household, us-
ing the conversion factors of 0.7, 0.1, 0.1 and 1.0 for cattle, goat, sheep and pigs
respectively (Tache and Sjaastad, 2010) to put these into one common unit;
T
4) Land size under utilization (LSU) was obtained by summing up the total
land area available for the household for crop, housing and grazing, and com-
E puted as less than 1 acre, between 1 and 2 acres, 2 to 5 acres, and above 5 acres
with the scores of 1 to 4 assigned, respectively.
f) Stability (S)
R Index presents an estimation of the value of losses due to land eviction, the
lower the loss the higher resilience for the household, as computed from the fol-
lowing factors:
1) Animal and crop shock (ACS) was the value-loss due to stolen or dead live-
stock during or after eviction;
2) Shocks others (SO) was used to summarize the value loss due to shocks
other than those considered in the previous two variables, for example droughts,
wild animals, diseases, illness, death, job changes;
3) Safety net dependency ratio (SDR) was computed as the amount of money
received under the safety net programme divided by total household income.
g) Resettlement option (RO)
This provided a variable to indicate the type of eviction and especially reset-
tlement:
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.79033 448 Open Journal of Applied SciencesJ. Ssekandi et al.
1) Reintegration represented evictees who settled within nearby communities
or found a host household proximity to where they had been evicted;
2) Settling in a conservation area represented a group that settled into land
gazette for a national park;
3) Settling in urban area represented the number of people that settled around
a landing site and changed livelihood activities.

3. Results
Factor loading
E
Estimates of the resilience index and its components are among the most im-
portant results that derive from the factor loading values in Table 2. We show
that in the income and food access category, all variables had a high index score
T
among pastoralists and off-farm livelihood groups, and the index was lower
among small holder farmers and agro pastoralists. Income and food security in-
dex score was much lower in coCmparison to daily income and daily expenditure.
For social safety nets, small holder farmers had a negative index score for
amount of cash and in-kind assistance (−0.715), while pastoralists had the high-
est index (0.665) forA income and food access as well as well as frequency of as-
sistance (0.829). Both small holder farmers and off farm livelihood groups had a
negative resilience index at −0.762 and −0.167, and these results indicated that
they had no extended family support network after eviction. Access to public
R
services had a negative index score for off farm livelihood and an even score for
all other categories. Small holder farmers negative score for income diversity
(−0.395), employment ratio (−0.550) and average education (−0.389) indicated a
T
lower adaptive capacity and thus higher vulnerability of small holder farmers.
Stability, the ability to retain a reasonable number of animals and crop fields,
E has a higher index score among pastoralist (0.011); the rest of the livelihood
groups had negative scores. Of note was an even lower index among pastoralists
which indicated a drop in yields and animal size. Reintegration scored a positive
R
index for small holder farmers and agro pastoralists and negative index for off
farm livelihoods and pastoralists. Small holder farmers and agro pastoralist were
therefore more easily reintegrated. The resilience index for evictees that settled
into an urban centre was negative for pastoralists and positive for the same
group that settled into a conservation area. Tenure security, no rights scored
highest for agro pastoralists and least for small holder farmers.
Resilience enhancing factors
Results from the Iterated Principal Factor Analysis indicate that income and
food access was evenly distributed among all livelihood groups (see Table 3).
Access to public services was high among small holders and negative for off farm
households.
Resettlement Option indicated a negative correlation for all livelihood groups
(small holder farmers −0.441, off farm livelihoods −0.033, pastoralists −0.036,

and agro pastoralists −0.057), this meant that none of the resettlement areas of-
fered a straightforward path to resilience. Physical Assets had a higher index
score forR pastoralists (0.420), and agro pastoralists had the lowest score at 0.044.
The positive score across livelihood groups indicate that physical assets are an
indicator of resilience for all evictees. Small holder farmers and agro pastoralists
Thad negative scores for adaptive capacity of −0.139 and −0.075, respectively;
hence these groups were more vulnerable. Pastoralists retained kinship support
in the new settlement areas and therefore had better social safety nets as is evi-

denced by communal land use for grazing and water. Agro pastoralists were the
most stable group with an index score at 0.232, while small holder farmers and
pastoralists had negative index scores at −0.163 and −0.327 which meant less re-

silient.
Resilient livelihoods
Overall results from resilience factors are presented in Table 4. Resilience
analysis indicates that small holder farmers and agro pastoralists fell into vul-
nerability as indicated by the consistent negative correlation scores. In contrast,
pastoralists and off farm livelihood households had the most resilient livelihoods
with positive correlation scores.
This study showed that pastoralist and off-farm dependent households had
the highest index score (0.692 and 0.632, respectively) compared to smallholder
farmers and agro-pastoralists households (−0.328 and −0.354, respectively). Key
informant interviews revealed that derived income came primarily from live-
stock and livestock products. Off farm households were involved in sale of forest
products surrounding forests and woodlands and fish smoking around Butyaba

landing site. Some causes of resilience are thus identified, but the actual situation
may be far more complex.
4. Discussion
The goals of this research were to understand the most useful methods for help-
ing individuals, households and communities to cope with and then recover
from the shocks of land evictions, and for them to become better off even after
D
thousands were forced to flee their lands in the oil rich Albertine region. The
study adds to an understanding of factors that lead to greater resilience of some
evictees than others, and to answer three initial questions. Which livelihoods
E
and resettlement typologies led to resilience and greater vulnerability, what were
the influencing factors for recovery and failure, these are either household or
mobility specific. Key results of the research show that a higher household food
T
security and access score is an apparent resilience enhancing factor. This is based
on three dimensions of food access: managing anxiety about being unable to
access sufficient food, inability Cto secure sufficient amounts of food, and expe-
rience of not having sufficient food intake. Households’ ability for absorbing the
impact and then recovering from disruptive events in land eviction is related to
pre eviction livelihooAds and asset holdings. Much importance has been found in
the family’s livestock, which in households is central to the livelihoods of the
poor and often forms an integral part of mixed farming systems; livestock pro-
vides souRrces of employment, income, quality food, fuel, draught power and fer-
tilizer [9]. The second factor is relying on forest resources for livelihoods and to
generate cash that is used to purchase food. Therefore households’ ability to
Tproduce and/or purchase food whether from sale of livestock and/or forest re-
sources creates assurance of the intake of sufficient, safe and quality food. It
helps to maintain availability, access and utilization in times of emergencies,
E shocks and stresses [10]. However, resilience to eviction and disruptions to eco-
systems and environmental disasters are inherently linked; the strong depen-
dency and interconnectedness to natural resources has potential risks of defore-
R
station, degradation of catchments/watersheds, degradation of land and deserti-
fication.
It is not surprising that we find a strong association between resilience and
resettlement options, specifically with reintegration. The negative socioeconomic
outcomes arose among the overwhelming majority of evictees that moved into
an already densely populated area. This correlation tells us little about the causal
impact of eviction on the hosts. We need more information on how new settlers
interact with their hosts and local economies in various ways, and whether these
have far-reaching consequences for their local hosts. One negative conse-
quence—the one most often cited is the threat that evictees pose to the land re-
sources where they settle specifically in buffer zones or open access areas such as
forests where people fetch firewood, communal spring wells where everyone
fetches water, and competition for communal grazing lands. Because land evic-
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.79033 453 Open Journal of Applied SciencesJ. Ssekandi et al.
tions can be long lasting, most evictees are reintegrated in nearby communities
for protracted periods, implying significant long-lasting impacts on host com-
munities and their livelihood security. Furthermore, most evictees reintegrated
may not necessarily enjoy better economic conditions and often may be strug-
gling with pre-existing resource scarcity in their new environment; there is no
guarantee that the reintegrated areas have fertile soils and water resources,
among other natural resources. Therefore reintegration may place further bur-
D
dens on the evictees and affect their current and future ability to withstand
shocks and achieve resilience. In addition to the survey results and analyses,
there were many observations and additional sources of information that help in
E
the interpretation of what was found. In this study we stress that maintaining a
flow of assistance in kind and cash is a major resilience. This was proven
through the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) where assistance in
T
form of remittances was found to provide cushioning against shocks and was of
central importance during the resettlement period as it remained the most im-
portant and sometimes the onCly supply line to ensure the survival for some
households. Small holder farmers for example had no time to harvest their crop
fields and orchards, and therefore without external support they would be facing
starvation; householAds with a flow of assistance from elsewhere avoided this.
Households with family members working away in urban areas relied on kinship
relations to meet short-term emergency relief to address medium-term needs
“deficits”. Support flow assisted in the recovery process and alleviated immediate
R
suffering by facilitating reconstruction efforts, reduced vulnerability and set in
place safety nets and strategies to mitigate the effects of potential humanitarian
crises. It is therefore important to have facilities so that Diaspora members can
T
continue sending support and aid to their families and communities.
Assistance in form of remittances had a positive correlation with household
E diversification towards off farm employment. Off-farm activities provide some
assurance of income and a route into diversified livelihoods that can create more
productive and decent employment opportunities. It is no surprise that this
R
group recovered more quickly compared to agro pastoralists and smallholders.
However, numerous concerns have been raised related to timeliness and high
cost of delivery to the recipients, as well as the costs to the giver in regards to
mobile money transfers.
The relationship between access to public goods and services and resilience
was found to be a negative one, although it was important to have availability
within walk able distances. The accessibility of public services in previous resi-
lience studies had been a reflection of the capacities to accurately recognize the
diversity and nature of different needs, create recovery channels accordingly,
and ensure equity and fairness in delivery and distribution [10] [11]. However,
evicted households were more concerned with reconstructing their lives, where
the available services seemed irrelevant at least for a short time. Social services
such as welfare benefits, social housing, or funding for further and higher educa-
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.79033 454 Open Journal of Applied SciencesJ. Ssekandi et al.
tion would attract evictees better since they address direct problems and speak to
individual perception and self-confidence about their own ability to handle fu-
ture events [12].
This study has been able to affirm the fact that pastoralists and off farm
households were the more resilient groups. Pastoral households have strong re-
silience since livestock is an inherent insurance against disaster. The positive
correlation between off farm households and resilience is of particular interest
D
because of the markets and unskilled casual labour opportunities created by the
oil sector [13]. The nonfarm sector also benefited from the increased demand
from petroleum sector workers, although at the cost of exploitation due to liter-
E
acy levels. Moreover, trade and employment opportunities have also emerged
around Wanseko areas. The construction of a 92-kilometer tarmac road that
links Hoima urban area to the oil-rich Kaiso-Tonya area is a driving force in
T
improving market efficiency in the area. In Buliisa, pastoralists have also taken
the opportunity to sell livestock products to the emerging population around oil
exploration areas. Livestock andC livestock products have been known as signifi-
cant buffers for pastoral households in the event of adverse conditions. However,
this study has been able to affirm the fact that pastoral households in fragile
ecosystems have stroAng resilience as livestock is an inherent insurance against
adversity [10]. The findings are in agreement with [14] that adaptive resource
use and livestock mobility practices build pastoralist households’ capacity to
withstand shocks and stresses [15].
R
5. Conclusions
TEmpirical findings from this study are in agreement with a recent discourse that
resilience is socially constructed, subjective and shaped in part by deep-
ly-embedded cultural and societal norms and values [16]. Our research further
E affirms the already held view that factors such as social capital are an important
element in the resilience of communities. This explains why pastoralists were the
most resilient livelihood group. Evictees had valuable assets in livestock and had
R
better social bonds to support one another; recovery was therefore a communal
responsibility rather than a household sole responsibility as supported by [17].
Ability to diversify into other livelihood groups was also seen as a critical factor
in recovery. The oil sector provided casual and semiskilled labour opportunities
for people around, and this study indicated that households that previously en-
gaged in off-farm livelihood households were more adaptive to diversification,
and hence recovered equally well due to the earning from wages, and thus were
more resilient.
It is important to create synergy between evictees and the oil sector, since this
emerging sector offers markets for products and income to aid recovery, and
therefore contributes to resilience. It goes without saying that the most impor-
tant solutions will come from national focus on the welfare of people, and from
not sacrificing the livelihoods of thousands of marginal citizens in the name of
DOI: 10.4236/ojapps.2017.79033 455 Open Journal of Applied SciencesJ. Ssekandi et al.
development at the national level. It has been said that the quality of a society
can be measured by how that society treats the least favoured individuals. En-
hancing the resilience of smallholder famers is of primary importance. This can
be achieved through maximizing the production potential of the fragmented
plots available and supporting them to build on local knowledge, and by pro-
tecting and improving soil and water resources. Smallholder farmers and agro
pastoralists lacked capacity to withstand post-eviction shocks because of their
D
inability to adjust and adapt to shocks in real time. Little is known about the ac-
tual consequences that evictees have on hosting communities, which is an im-
portant area of further investigation.
