The authors haveretracted thisarticle (Saltzmanand Myers,
2018) because upon re-review of the data, a programming
error was found that led to unequal presentations of items
during the test phases of the experiment. The conclusions
drawn are therefore unreliable. The authors have performed

RETRACTION
Urgent Announcement From the Editor-in-Chief
Concerning Article Retractions
Hiroaki Shimokawa, MD, PhD
The editorial team of Circulation Journal has recently confirmed that the manuscript written by Shinzo
Kimura et al, Circ J 2012 September 12 [Epub ahead of print] and that by Jun Shiraishi et al, published in
the April 2011 issue of the Circulation Journal (Circ J 2011; 75: 806 – 814) contain a number of serious
errors in data analysis.

HEART Study Group. Effects of valsartan on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk hyper-
tensive patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus: Sub-analysis of the KYOTO HEART Study. Circ J 2012

patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: Sub-analysis of the KYOTO HEART study. Circ J 2011; 75:
806 – 814.
Therefore, we have decided to retract the papers from Circulation Journal.
As the Editor-in-Chief, I regret the time that peer reviewers and others spent evaluating these papers.
I sincerely hope and trust that there will be no repetition of this kind in the future.

https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11192- 020- 03852-4
The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article (Macháček & Srholec, 2021) because some
of the findings are unreliable. Post-publication peer review indicated the article includes
statements about authors from some geographic regions which are unjustified in the gener-
ality of the conclusions. Findings are based on a regression analysis; however, this analysis
did not include a control group. The regression analysis is, therefore, not complete and the
results are unreliable.
Results and findings are based on a so-called blacklist and are not supplemented by
any results obtained using a positive control group. In this context, the Scopus database
cannot be considered a control group, since it is a comprehensive bibliographic database.
Similarly, the analysis was restricted to publications in four languages (English, Spanish,
French, and Arabic). The results of the regression analysis are inconclusive for publica-
tions in languages not included in the analysis. The authors have been offered the oppor-
tunity to submit a new reworked manuscript for peer review. Vít Macháček and Martin
Srholec disagree with this retraction.

Retraction: High predictability of the winter Euro–Atlantic climate from
cryospheric variability
J. García-Serrano and C. Frankignoul
Nature Geoscience http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2118; published online 23 March 2014; retracted 14 April 2014
In our Letter, a conceptual error in the cross-validation approach led to an overestimation of the predictive skill of the winter
(December–February) North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Euro-Atlantic surface climate from Arctic sea-ice variability. The error
does not affect the hindcasts based on the snow advance index.
Specifically, to produce the one-year-out cross-validated hindcasts based on Arctic sea-ice variability, we performed a maximum
covariance analysis (MCA) between Arctic sea-ice concentration (SIC) anomalies and winter Euro-Atlantic sea-level pressure anomalies
in the period 1979/80 to 2012/13. We then applied one-year-out cross-validation using subsets of years from the SIC time series derived
from the whole period. Thereby, the regression coefficients (that is, slope and intercept) and predictor value of the statistical model were
estimated assuming the knowledge of the MCA fields in the year out. This procedure overestimates the cross-validation skill.
One-year-out cross-validated hindcasts instead require cross-validation of the MCA pattern-generation in the year out, thus performing
an MCA on the remaining years. Following this approach, the cross-validated skill in hindcasting the winter NAO index using September
SIC over the whole Arctic is 0.08, indicating that there is no predictive skill from Arctic sea-ice variability. The cross-validated NAO skill
using October or November SIC over the whole Arctic is 0.22 and 0.18, respectively, suggesting some skill.
Although our analysis reveals no skill in sea-ice-based NAO predictions with three months lead time, the limited skill from
October–November sea-ice concentration supports the notion that sea-ice information should be incorporated in dynamical prediction
systems to improve their skill at forecasting the surface winter climate in Europe.
Following the identification of the error in our cross-validation approach, this Letter has been retracted. We are grateful to
Geert Jan van Oldenborgh (KNMI, De Bilt, The Netherlands) for identifying this error. We also thank Francisco J. Doblas-Reyes (IC3,
Barcelona, Spain) for discussions.

DIFFRACTIVE IMAGING OF NANOPARTICLES ON A SUBSTRATE
J. S. WU, U. WEIERSTALL AND J. SPENCE
Nature Materials 4, 912–916 (2005).
In the above article, the authors described the reconstruction of an atomic-resolution image of a small gold particle lying on a thin, car-
bon substrate from electron diff raction data, using a new iterative phasing algorithm. Subsequent re-analysis of this data shows that the
image solution recovered was not unique, and that the substrate scattering is incorrectly treated. Th e authors therefore wish to retract

The authors have retracted this article because following
verification, the results of the statistical analysis of the
data presented in Fig. 4D and Fig. 6D were identified to
be incorrect; specifically, the TUNEL assay results indi-
cated that microRNA-144 could not reverse the effects of
HCG11 on apoptosis, which affected the overall conclu-

Retraction of: Scientific Reports https: //doi.org/10.1038/s41598 -020-60534- 0, published online 27 February 2020.
The authors have retracted this Article. It has been brought to the Authors’ attention1 that the eggs found in the
buccal cavity of the examined specimen may actually be those of a species of crab. Re-analysis of the original
samples confirmed this to be the case. While the breeding ecology of Parazen pacificus remains unknown and
the species appears to be exapted for mouthbrooding, we find that the original data is not sufficient to confirm
that this species is a mouth brooder.
All authors agree with the retraction.

Retraction Note: Large local lattice expansion in graphene adlayers grown on copper
Chaoyu Chen , José Avila, Hakim Arezki, Van Luan Nguyen, Jiahong Shen, Marcin Mucha-Kruczyński, Fei Yao,
Mohamed Boutchich, Yue Chen, Young Hee Lee and Maria C. Asensio
Retraction of: Nature Materials https://doi.org/10.1038/s41563-018-0053-1, published online 9 April 2018.
The authors unanimously wish to retract this Article due to their concerns about the interpretation of the low-energy electron micros-
copy (LEEM) and diffraction (LEED) patterns reported in the manuscript. In this study, the authors used spatial and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to characterize graphene monolayers grown on copper foils, and observed regions of graphene
adlayers with enhanced graphene/Cu interaction, higher Dirac cone doping level, moiré mini Dirac cones and large lattice expansion.
All these properties have been clearly verified and reproduced by photoemission spectroscopy as well as explained by density functional
theory. LEEM and LEED characterization were also carried out to confirm the existence of a moiré superlattice and lattice expansion,
and the results were included in the main manuscript and Supplementary Information. On further analysis of the LEEM/LEED data,
it seems that while the existence of a moiré superlattice can be corroborated, the conclusion of graphene lattice expansion (7%) based
on spatially resolved ARPES determinations cannot be confirmed by the LEEM/LEED measurements. The authors realized that these
measurements were collected from statistically non-representative areas of the sample. Moreover, the fact that the raw microLEED
images bear an asymmetry factor of as much as 5% due to the instrumental aberration makes it impossible to estimate any compression
or expansion of the same order. Consequently, their conclusion on the graphene lattice expansion can only be supported by the
photoemission data. In view that more complete and reliable structural determinations should be conducted, all authors wish to
retract this Article.

Retraction Notice: Suicide Rates by Occupational
Group — 17 States, 2012
On July 1, 2016, MMWR published “Suicide Rates by
Occupational Group — 17 States, 2012” (1). On June 14,
2018, the authors informed MMWR about their concerns
regarding the validity of some of the findings in the report,
and on June 29, 2018, MMWR published “Notice to Readers:
Ongoing Analysis of Suicide Rates Data by Occupational
Group from Results Reported in MMWR” (2). The analysis is
complete, and because the corrections change the conclusions,
the original report is retracted.
A new MMWR report, “Suicide Rates by Major Occupational
Group — 17 States, 2012 and 2015,” is published today (3).
This report corrects inadvertent errors in the retracted report,
uses updated methodology, includes authors from the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and additional
authors from the National Center for Injury Prevention and
Control, and provides analysis of both 2012 and 2015 National
Violent Death Reporting System data. Corrected errors include
the manual misclassification of some occupation codes in the
earlier report (e.g., erroneous coding of farmers to the Farming,
Fishing, and Forestry major occupational group instead of to
the correct Management major occupational group), which
led to errors in reporting of suicide numbers and rates in
some groups.

1. JOURNAL MISSION AND SCOPE
Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance (AMHP) is published monthly (in print and
electronic formats) by the Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) for the benefit of its membership
and to serve and support those who explore, travel, work, or live in hazardous environments ranging
from beneath the sea to the outermost reaches of space. The journal's readership includes a diverse
mix of physicians, physiologists, psychologists, nurses, engineers, and others working in aerospace
medicine and related areas. The scientific content of the journal is subject to strict peer review.
2. SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS
Manuscripts must have gone through all reviews and be approved for public release before being
submitted electronically using the web-based system at http://EditorialManager.com/amhp.
Questions concerning submission should be directed to the Editorial Office at
amhpjournal@asma.org.
1The journal is now accepting Open Access articles, for which there is a standard fee of $15001.
Authors interested in this option should download the Agreement to Pay Extra Charges and the Open
Access License Agreement from Editorial Manager.
The journal publishes four main types of articles:
• Research Articles may address basic, applied, or clinical research. They should present
the results of experimental or descriptive studies with suitable statistical analysis of results
arranged into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion,
ending with a statement of conclusions. Such manuscripts may not exceed 6000 words with
approximately 25 references, 4 Tables, and 4 Figures.
• Review Articles are scholarly reviews of the literature on important subjects within the
scope of the journal. It is suggested that authors considering preparation of a Review
Article contact the Editor to ascertain the suitability of the topic. Reviews generally may
not exceed 6000 words with up to 150 references. Longer reviews of exceptional quality
and relevance may be considered.
• Short Communications describe new techniques, devices, or interesting preliminary
findings that may serve as the basis for further definitive research. They should contain the
same sections as a Research Article but may not exceed 3000 words with approximately 12
references and a combined total of 4 Tables/Figures.
• Case Reports describe interesting or unusual clinical cases or aeromedical events. They
should include a short Introduction to provide perspective, details of the Case, and a
Discussion that includes references to pertinent literature. Such manuscripts may not
exceed 3000 words with approximately 12 references and a combined total of 4
Tables/Figures.
Other types of manuscripts may be considered at the discretion of the Editor, including:
• Historical Notes are brief presentations regarding past events of significance in the
development of aviation and space medicine.
• Technical Notes are a type of Short Communication that describes a new device or novel
technique that may be promising for studying and working in aerospace and other extreme
environments.
• Commentaries are brief essays that set forth opinions or perspectives on relevant topics.
Such manuscripts may not exceed 1000 words with approximately 10 references. They
should contain an abstract of 150 words or less.
• Letters to the Editor discuss and/or criticize scientific papers that have appeared in the
journal within the past year and are limited to 500 words. The author of the original paper
will be invited to provide a response.
There are also several special features (e.g., Aerospace Medicine Clinic, Sci-Tech Watch, Book
Review, etc.) published in the journal. If you are interested in contributing, please contact the journal
office.
3. LIMITS ON PRIOR PUBLICATION
AMHP will not ordinarily review for publication any work under consideration, accepted, or
published by another journal. However, an author may submit a paper that expands on material that
has appeared as an abstract or brief preprint or that was rejected by another journal. When submitting
a paper, the Cover Letter must contain a full statement regarding any previous versions that have
1 Open Access articles are made freely available to the public to promote the accessibility of research and remove
barriers to sharing knowledge, but they are not a sustainable business practice for most journals without a
standard author fee.
2been posted online on any website both formally and informally. For posted preprints, links to those
are required. Copies of such material should be sent to the Editorial Office via separate e-mail,
attaching any document(s) that may aid the Editor’s decision in handling the matter.
4. QUALIFICATIONS FOR AUTHORSHIP
This journal adheres to the criteria for authorship developed by the International Committee of
Medical Journal Editors (icmje.org). Accordingly, authorship credit should be granted only to
persons who meet all four of the following criteria:
1) substantial contributions to conception and design of the study, or acquisition of data, or
analysis and interpretation of results;
2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;
3) final approval of the version to be published; AND
4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the study to ensure that questions related to
the accuracy or integrity of any part of the study are appropriately investigated and
resolved.
All persons who meet these criteria should be listed as authors. The order of authorship on the
byline should be a joint decision of the co-authors, and the Corresponding Author should be prepared
to explain that order. If there are more than seven authors, the contributions of each author should be
included in the cover letter so the Editor can determine if all authors meet the above criteria.
Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group without
meeting the other criteria does not justify authorship. Persons in those roles should be credited in the
Acknowledgments. Examples might include a person who provided purely technical help or a
department chair who provided only general support.
5. AI POLICY
Generative AI is no longer on the horizon–it has arrived. As such, it is critical for the integrity
and quality of our journal that we establish a policy for both authors and peer reviewers regarding the
use of these tools. While there are exciting opportunities for innovation with this new technology,
there are also undeniable risks. These include but are not limited to: loss of control over original data;
potential breach of Institutional Review Board approval; inaccuracies introduced by AI
hallucinations; perpetuated biases; infringement upon copyrights held by others; and having one’s
own copyright rendered unenforceable.
The scholarly publishing community appears to have reached a consensus regarding several
aspects of if/how generative AI should be permitted in the development and review of research
articles. In establishing the policy for AMHP, we have aligned ourselves with leading industry
organizations such as the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), the World
Association of Medical Editors (WAME), Springer Nature, Science, Cambridge University Press,
Elsevier, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), and the Council of Science
Editors (CSE).
The spirit of the policies outlined below is that authors are expected to use generative AI as a
polishing tool at best and a translator at most, but not as a replacement for original thought. Please
note that standard referencing software tools are not considered “generative AI” and, therefore, are
not subject to these policies.
Our journal staff and Editorial Board are committed to regularly reviewing and revising our
policy as technologies continue to develop over time and the industry finds new ways to cope with
the inevitable rise of generative AI.
• ChatGPT, Large Language Models, and any other generative AI programs cannot be listed
as an author or co-author, nor cited as an author or co-author in the references.
3• ChatGPT, Large Language Models, and any other generative AI programs cannot be used
to create images, multimedia, or graphic elements.
• Authors must disclose the use of any generative AI tool in their cover letter to
editors/reviewers at the submission stage and in the Methods section of their manuscript.
The statement should include:
o The name and version of the generative AI tool used.
o A description of how the generative AI tool was used and for what purpose.
o The full prompt(s) submitted to the generative AI tool, including the date and time of
each query (to be submitted as supplementary material).
• Authors are responsible for the accuracy, completeness, and originality of the content in
their manuscript.
• Authors are expected to verify all AI-generated output for accuracy, completeness, and
proper citation, as well as take action to combat biases that may be perpetuated by
generative AI tools. Authors should describe the steps taken to mitigate risks in the
Methods section of their manuscript.
• Any manuscript determined to be in violation of our AI policies will be rejected.
If, at any point, you are in doubt about the tools you have used or how you have used them,
please contact our Editor-in-Chief, Dr. David Newman, at amhped@asma.org or the Assistant to the
Editor, Sandy Kawano, at amhpjournal@asma.org.
6. USE OF HUMAN SUBJECTS
a. Ethics
AsMA endorses the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki
(https://www.wma.net/what-we-do/medical-ethics/declaration-of-helsinki/doh-oct2008/).
Experimental protocols must be approved by the appropriate committee for ethical review of human
experimentation, and voluntary consent must be obtained from subjects after they have been fully
informed of the nature of the experiment, any hazards involved, and their right to withdraw from the
experiment at any time without prejudice or penalty. Inclusion of the following statement at the
beginning of Methods will be understood by the Editor as the author's affirmation of compliance:
“The study protocol was approved in advance by [name of committee and/or its institutional
sponsor]. Each subject provided written informed consent before participating.”
A study may be exempt from the above requirements if: a) the data were collected non-invasively
during work or training that the subjects would have undertaken had no experiment existed; or b) the
data were collected using anonymous questionnaires. In either case, the reason for exemption must
be described under Methods.
Authors reporting on human experimentation that does not include both male and female subjects
must explain, under Methods, the reason for not doing so.
b. Confidentiality
Reporting of individual data is not appropriate in Research Articles. Human subjects or patients
in Case Reports must never be identified by name, initials, photographs, or other information that can
be used to single out the individual unless the author has obtained written permission for the use of
such material and provides a copy to the journal.
47. USE AND CARE OF ANIMALS
AsMA endorses research of high scientific quality that involves the responsible use of
experimental animals. Each scientist who performs such research must assume responsibility for the
general welfare and humane handling of the animals, which must also be maintained under the
surveillance of a veterinarian. Adherence to policies and procedures from the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (or comparable
standards) is required, and the experimental protocol must be approved in advance by the appropriate
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (or a comparable body). The standard of care, the
name of the approving committee, and the fact that the animals were maintained under the
surveillance of a veterinarian must be stated at the beginning of the Methods in the manuscript.
8. LANGUAGE, ABBREVIATIONS, AND MEASUREMENTS
The language of the journal is standard American English in the style specified by the most
recent edition of the U.S. Government Publishing Office (https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/gpo-
style-manual). The journal cannot provide translation or rewriting services; authors who are not
fluent in English should have the manuscript edited by a native speaker before submission. The
journal will decline to review manuscripts not sufficiently clear for reviewers to follow the argument
of the paper.
Abbreviations and acronyms should be used only if they improve the readability of the text. The
full term for which an abbreviation stands must precede its first use in the abstract and again in the
text. Abbreviations should only be used if the relevant term appears at least three times within the
text. These caveats do not apply to standard units of measurement, which do not require explanation.
Measurements of length, weight, volume, and pressure should be reported in metric units and
temperatures should be given in degrees Celsius (customary English units such as degrees Fahrenheit
may be added in parentheses; altitude and depth should be in feet with equivalent meters in
parentheses). Hematological and clinical chemistries should generally be reported in the metric
system in accordance with the International System of Units (SI). However, AMHP allows reporting
of clinical values in the terms used by the examining laboratory. Blood pressures should be given in
millimeters of mercury.
9. MEDICAL STATISTICAL REPORTING
Please follow these guidelines to avoid reporting errors commonly found in scientific articles:
http://www.equator-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SAMPL-Guidelines-6-27-13.pdf.
10. TABLES, FIGURES, AND ANCILLARY MATERIAL
Tables and Figures should be used strictly to advance the argument of the paper and to assess its
support. Lists and simple quantitative information (e.g., characteristics of a group of subjects) should
be incorporated into the text.
In general, Tables are best used when readers need to be able to compare exact numbers, while
graphs should be used to show patterns of change or trends—or as an alternative to large Tables.
Authors should plan their Tables and Figures to fit either one journal column (8.5 cm), 1.5
columns (12.5 cm), or the full width of the printed page (18 cm).
In the rare situation where an accepted manuscript contains a Table or Figure that has been
published elsewhere, the original source must be acknowledged in the caption and the Corresponding
Author must provide written permission from the copyright holder to reproduce the material. Such
permission is required irrespective of authorship or publisher, unless the document is in the public
domain.
5Although there is no page charge for articles, a charge will be assessed for Tables or Figures in
excess of the numbers previously (see SUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPTS above) or totaling more
than 20% of the area of the article in print. Upon payment of the required fees, such material may
appear in print or solely in the electronic edition of the journal at the discretion of the Editor.
a. Tables
All Tables should be created using the Table function in Microsoft Word or WordPerfect. Tables
should be assigned consecutive Roman numerals in the order of their first citation in the text. Do not
use internal horizontal or vertical lines or shading.2 Each column should have a short or abbreviated
heading. Explanation of details and any nonstandard abbreviations should be presented in footnotes
designated by the symbols *, †, ‡, §, ¶, **, ††, and so on in that sequence.
Tables should not ordinarily occupy more than 20% of the space in a journal article. Data too
extensive to print in the journal may be considered for publication as ancillary material (see below).
b. Figures
Figures include graphs, photographs, and drawings and should be assigned consecutive Arabic
numerals in the order of their first citation in the text. The journal does not ordinarily publish
photographs of experimental equipment; if the paper discusses details of the setup, the author should
provide a line drawing with appropriate markings.
Each axis on a graph must be labeled with “Variable (units)” and numbered appropriately. A key
to symbols is allowed, provided it fits within the rectangle of the graph. There should be no other text
in the graphic file. Graphs must be submitted in black and white; grayscale may only be used if the
grays are distinct; bars or other filled areas should use bold patterns (e.g., thick diagonal stripes) such
that the differences between them are clear at publication scale. Three-dimensional graphs may be
used only for three-dimensional data. It is important to visualize graphics at the reduced size at
which they will be published to be sure that legends, lines, and symbols remain clear.
Each Figure should be submitted as a separate electronic file using PDF, EPS, TIFF, JPEG, or
other common electronic format.
When exporting Figures for submission, please refrain from compressing, adjusting, or altering
the file unnecessarily. Raw images are preferred. If any Figure is of insufficient quality, the
Corresponding Author will be asked to submit a replacement file.
c. Ancillary Tables or Figures
Material that contributes to the paper but is not well-suited to the print journal may, at the
discretion of the Editor, be designated “ancillary material” to be published in the Electronic Edition
only; a charge will be made for such publication. Examples include the full text of questionnaires,
large Tables, derivation of mathematical equations, and material that will be used only by a small
subset of readers. Such material should be submitted with the manuscript as a separate file that can
be considered during peer review and will be accepted at the discretion of the Editor following peer
review.
2 Tables within this instructional document may be formatted using these tools for legibility. Tables within your
manuscripts do not need these tools because formatting will be handled at the typesetting stage, prior to
publication.
6d. Graphics Guidelines
In order to meet AsMA’s quality standards for publication, it is important that authors submit
digital art that conforms to the appropriate resolution, color mode, and file format. Doing so will
avoid delays in publication and maximize the quality of images in both the online and print journals.
[See DOCUMENTS TO DOWNLOAD on the journal’s Editorial Manager page for a printable
digital art guide.]
Color Mode: All Color image files are required to be submitted in their original RGB color.
Whenever possible, tag the submitted RGB image with the originating ICC profile to ensure the best
possible conversion to CMYK for the printed journal. Please note: there is a fee for printing in color.
Labeling and Font Usage: Please use the same font for all Figures in your manuscript; use
standard fonts such as Arial, Helvetica, Times, Symbol, Mathematical Pi, and European Pi. For
vector application files, it is recommended to convert fonts to outlines (Adobe Illustrator) or embed
fonts (MS Office).
Sizing: Prepare Figures at the final publication size; less than the length of the page
(57.25 picas / 9.5” / 24.25 cm), and one of the following widths:
• 1 column wide (20.5 picas / 3.4” / 8.7cm)
• 1.5 columns wide (31.5 picas / 5.25” / 13.33 cm)
• 2 columns wide (42.5 picas / 7.1” / 18 cm)
Resolution and Raster Images: Low-resolution images are one of the leading causes of art
resubmission and schedule delays. It is important that submitted raster images meet the minimum
resolution requirements. Raster images can be classified as monochrome, halftone, or combination
halftone.
Monochrome (1-bit) Images*: Common examples are graphs and charts made of solid black
and white, with no gray values. The preferred resolution for this type of image is between 1000 and
1200 dpi at publication size. The preferred file format is TIFF. PDF and EPS are also accepted.
Halftones*: Common examples are color or grayscale Figures containing pictures only, with no
text or thin lines. The suggested minimum resolution for this type of image is 300 dpi at publication
size. The preferred file format is TIFF. EPS and PDF are also accepted.
Combination Halftones*: Common examples are color or grayscale Figures containing
halftone and line art elements. The preferred resolution for this type of image is between 600 and 900
dpi at publication size. The preferred file format is TIFF. EPS and PDF are also accepted.
Combination Halftones Halftones
Monochrome
(grayscale or color images and type) (grayscale or color with no type or lettering)
900-1200 dpi 600-900 dpi 300 dpi
*When saving these files, use only LZW compression.
11. REFERENCES
The Corresponding Author is responsible for providing complete, accurate references so a reader
can locate the original material. Only references directly relevant to the argument of the paper should
be cited. Preferred sources include peer-reviewed journals and books with ISBN designations.
Technical reports and theses may be cited if the original report is accessible to the public. Abstracts
and web sites should be cited only if no other source is available. References should ordinarily be in
English or at least contain an English abstract; titles in another language should be followed by an
English translation in parentheses along with an indication of the original language at the end of the
citation.
7References should be cited using superscripts in numeric order in the text or the Tables and
Figure legends and the list should be created after all the references have been cited. For in-text
citations, ensure that no more than three citations are listed at the end of a sentence or phrase. The
titles of cited journals should be abbreviated as in the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s Medline,
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/). Examples of correct format for many different types of
references can be downloaded from the journal’s Editorial Manager page [See DOCUMENTS TO
DOWNLOAD for a printable reference-formatting guide based on the NLM Style Guide for Authors,
Editors, and Publishers].
Reference to papers for which authors have received a letter of acceptance but which have not yet
been published must include the journal name and the words “in press.” Information from
manuscripts in preparation or submitted but not yet accepted should be cited in the text as
(unpublished observations).
Unpublished communications may not be included in the list of references. Written
communications may instead be inserted in the text provided the author has obtained written

(Note: titles should not exceed 100 characters and spaces.)
• Authors: Given name, middle initial, family name, highest academic degree(s) (maximum
of 2), accrediting institution for each degree, current institutional affiliation, and e-mail
address of each author.
• Abstract: Paste into the box an exact copy of the Abstract that appears as part of the
manuscript.
• Keywords: List 3-4 key words at the bottom of the abstract page. These will be used for
indexing.
• Classifications: The Corresponding Author should review the entire list of
Classifications and select several to indicate the areas of interest and expertise appropriate
for reviewers of the manuscript. The editor may modify this list before instituting review.
• Attached (SEPARATELY) Files:
o Cover Letter containing:
1. A statement that the work is original, has not been published elsewhere, and is
not currently under consideration by another journal. If the work has been posted
as a preprint, provide the link. Otherwise, provide detailed information on those
issues.
2. A statement that there is no financial or other relationship that might be perceived
as leading to a conflict of interest (i.e., affecting author objectivity). If such
relationships do exist, provide detailed information.
83. A statement that the manuscript has been read and approved by all authors and all
named authors meet the appropriate criteria. If there are seven or more authors,
explain the specific contributions of each that justifies their inclusion as an author
(see QUALIFICATIONS FOR AUTHORSHIP above).
4. Authors of papers based on statistical inference must inform the Editor whether
one of the authors is a trained statistician (has had some graduate training in
statistics) or whether such a person was used as a consultant and has agreed to be
named in the Acknowledgments. Absent such expertise, the Editor-in-Chief may
submit the paper to one of the journal's statistical consultants for review.
5. Authors are requested to suggest the names of two or more scientists whom they
regard as appropriate reviewers for their paper; the current e-mail and
institutional affiliation of the candidates must be included. Authors may also
name an individual to whom the paper should not be sent, where bias or conflict
of interest is known to exist.
o Required Forms (available under DOCUMENTS TO DOWNLOAD on the journal’s
Editorial Manager page):
1. Author Checklist. Every manuscript must be accompanied by this document. It
should be completed prior to submission to ensure the manuscript is properly
formatted and the required signed documents are included.
2. Copyright Release. Every manuscript must be accompanied by this document,
either releasing the copyright or stating that the work cannot be copyrighted
because it was done in a government facility.
3. Conflict of Interest. Every manuscript must be accompanied by this document.
Complete blocks 1-4 and blocks 5 and/or 6 as applicable. On page 3, all authors
must sign and date.
o Manuscript3 containing:
1. Title Page
• We no longer want authors’ information included on the title page for
initial submissions. Do not place names of authors, titles, degrees, or
institution affiliations on the title page of the manuscript document.
• Title that indicates the subject matter and nature of the study. It may contain
no more than 100 characters and spaces. It should not include punctuation
marks or use abbreviations except those already widely understood (e.g.,
MRI). Animal studies should include the common name of the species (e.g.,
“rats”). We discourage the inclusion of geographic or organizational names.
We encourage starting with important words rather than phrases such as “The
effect of…” or “A study of…”
• Suggested short title to go at the top of the journal page; limit is 30 characters
and spaces.
• Manuscript metrics (word count for abstract, word count for main text,
number of references, number of Tables, and number of Figures).
3 Note: Each numbered item should start on a NEW page and the entire manuscript should be DOUBLE-SPACED.
Page numbers should appear in the UPPER RIGHT corner of each page.
92. Abstract Page
• The abstract should be a one-paragraph “mini-paper” of no more than 250
words (150 words for Commentaries), with the same major headings as the
paper (for example: background, methods, results, discussion). Results should
include important descriptive numerical data without specific P-values.
Because abstracts are the only substantive portion of the article many readers
see, abstracts must accurately reflect the content of the article.
• At the bottom of the abstract page, the author should list 3 to 5 keywords or
short phrases that do not appear in the title. Keywords are used for indexing
and should include terms that would occur to a knowledgeable reader while
conducting a literature search.
3. Main Text
• INTRODUCTION: Briefly summarize the rationale for the study and clearly
state the hypothesis or research question. This should contain only strictly
pertinent references and is not the place for an extensive review of the
literature. No more than three in-text citations are permitted at the end of a
single sentence or phrase.
• METHODS: Describe methods in sufficient detail to allow other workers to
repeat the study. Clearly describe criteria for selection of the subjects or
patients, including controls. As much as possible, standard subheading should
be used. For example, for an experimental study, appropriate subheadings
might include: subjects, equipment, procedure, design, and statistical analysis.
For established methods, give references without going into detail; for
methods published but not well known, provide references and brief
descriptions; for new or substantially modified methods, give details along
with reasons for using them and their limitations. If an unusual apparatus was
used, name it and give in parentheses the manufacturer’s name and location
(city, state, and country). Authors submitting systematic review articles or
meta-analyses should include the methods used for locating, selecting,
extracting, and synthesizing data.
• RESULTS: Present results in logical sequence using text, Tables, and/or
Figures. Data should appear in only one format (text, Table, or graph)
depending on which is best for clear, concise presentation (see TABLES,
FIGURES, AND AUXILIARY MATERIAL above). Noncontributory results
should be omitted. Subheadings should be avoided as much as possible.
Statistical results should contain the calculated statistic and degrees of
freedom, in addition to p-value. When statistical significance is revealed,
exact p-values are preferred.
• DISCUSSION: Emphasize the new and important aspects of the study and the
conclusions that follow from them. Do not repeat in detail data or other
material given in the Introduction or the Results section. For experimental
studies, it is useful to begin the discussion by briefly summarizing the main
findings, then explore possible mechanisms or explanations for these
findings, compare the results with other relevant studies, state the limitations
of the study, and explore the implications of the findings for future research
and clinical practice. The final paragraph should be a statement of
conclusions linked to the goals of the study, as stated in the Introduction and
directly supported by the data. Avoid claiming priority or alluding to work
10that has not been completed. State new hypotheses when warranted, but
clearly label them as such.
4. Acknowledgments including the following as appropriate:
• Acknowledgment of professional contributions other than authorship (see
above) and/or technical assistance. All persons acknowledged must give their
written permission to be named.
• Acknowledgments of financial and material support, specifying its nature
(e.g., equipment or drugs).
• Statement of financial or other relationships that could be viewed as causing
bias or conflict of interest for any of the authors.
• Institutional disclaimers and other required statements.
5. References (see REFERENCES above)
6. Tables (see TABLES, FIGURES, AND ANCILLARY MATERIALS above)
7. Captions for Figures
• Each Figure must have a caption that names the variables and explains
abbreviations, symbols or marks on the graphic, and value of error bars; the
caption should not include comments about results. Captions should not
appear with the Figures but should be placed in numerical order on the last
page of the manuscript file.
o Figures
1. Each graphic file should be loaded as a separate file named “Fig. #” (see
TABLES, FIGURES, AND ANCILLARY MATERIALS above).
13. OTHER DOCUMENTS
The following items, IF APPLICABLE, must be uploaded during original submission or revision
or submitted to the Editorial Office by email or fax:
• Agreement to pay extra charges: This form is available under DOCUMENTS TO
DOWNLOAD on the journal’s Editorial Manager page. It is required to affirm that the
authors will pay the required fees for open access or for papers that contain more than the
allowed number of Figures and Tables, require color printing, or require preparation of
auxiliary material for the Electronic Edition only. It must be signed where applicable.
• Permissions: Copies of permission to reproduce published materials, use illustrations or
report sensitive personal information of identifiable persons, use an identifiable person in a
photograph, or acknowledge people for their contributions must be provided.
14. PEER REVIEW
Unbiased, independent, critical assessment is an intrinsic part of all scholarly work, including the
scientific process. Experts who are not part of the editorial staff conduct peer review at the request of
the Editor-in-Chief. Peer review is an important extension of the scientific process, helps editors
decide which manuscripts are suitable for their journals, and helps authors and editors in their efforts
to improve the quality of reporting. Reviewers for this journal are asked to excuse themselves if there
is any possible conflict of interest. Reviewers, who volunteer their time, provide comments for the
authors and may also make confidential comments to the editor. Although reviewers may
recommend the disposition of an article, the final decision to accept or reject is the responsibility of
the Editor-in-Chief.
1115. PUBLICATION PROCEDURES
Once the Editor has accepted a manuscript, the electronic source files for text and Figures (TIFF
or EPS preferred) are forwarded to the publisher, the Aerospace Medical Association, for conversion
to printable format and final copy-editing. Correspondence related to publication should be directed
to the Managing Editor at the Association Home Office: (703) 739-2240, X101; rtrigg@asma.org.
When the paper is ready for publication, the printer will send an email with a link to download
the PDF file to the Corresponding Author, who is responsible for correcting any errors and for
responding to any “Author Queries” (Qs).

A few weeks after publication of this Article, as a result of comments
from James Kirchner and colleagues, we realized that our assembled
dataset of paired watershed studies, used to assess the streamflow
response to forest removal and planting, contains errors in the percent-
age change in streamflow associated with land cover modifications.
Second, the effects of continent-wide forest removal on streamflow
(Table 1 of the Article) are overestimated, because we assumed a start-
ing condition of 100% forest cover. Third, there are serious concerns
regarding model validation that need to be assessed using the cor-
rected data. Correcting these honest mistakes goes beyond a simple
Author Correction, and therefore we and the Nature editors wish to
retract this Article. There are two Matters Arising that accompany this
Retraction Note, by James W. Kirchner et al. (https://doi.org/10.1038/

(https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-1941-5). We have decided not to
respond because we do not wish to cause further confusion by defend-
ing a retracted paper. We are working with Kirchner and colleagues
to constructively address the issues raised in a revised paper; if and
when it is published we will alert readers by posting a comment to this

The authors of this Article have requested that it is retracted. In the western blotting analysis, the rabbit mono-
clonal antibody to human mutant p53 rather than wild type p53 (1:1000, ab32049, Abcam) was used. While in
the immunohistochemistry detection, the mouse monoclonal antibody to both wild-type and mutant forms of
human p53 (1:100, ab28, Abcam) was used. The authors believe that the use of antibodies for both wild type p53
and mutant p53 is not appropriate because it cannot reflect the overexpression status of mutant TP53. The results
as described in the manuscript stated that the number of patients with overexpression of mutant p53 was 84/241
(34.9%), using the mouse monoclonal antibody to both wild-type and mutant forms of human p53 (1:100, ab28,
Abcam). Ninety (37.3%) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) showed a virtual absence of p53 immuno-
labeling compared with the adjacent normal tissues. These patients were also considered to be “abnormal” in p53
immunolabeling. In contrast, the normal immunolabeling of p53 was detected in 67 (27.8%) of the 241 PDACs.
However, the authors later found that the number of patients with overexpression of mutant p53 was actually
113/241 (46.9%) in these same specimens when using the specific anti-mutant p53 antibody (1:100, ab32049,
Abcam). This inconsistency could impact the subsequent analyses and the previous conclusion of this study
could not be drawn. Therefore, the authors feel they cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results and conclusions
described in this paper, and believe it is necessary to retract it.

Since publication, it has come to our attention that the uncertainties
associated with the results presented in Fig. 1 of our manuscript are
underestimated. The underestimation stems from two issues that were
overlooked in the analysis. The first relates to the application of variance
normalization, as we normalized the model-based land sink estimates
but did not normalize the observation-based estimates. The second
owes to our treatment of land sink error estimates as random rather
than systematic errors. Although correcting these issues by removing
the variance normalization and using appropriate uncertainty values
did not substantially change the central estimate of the effect of CO on
2
global photosynthesis, it led to a roughly threefold increase in uncer-
tainties, significantly weakening the derived emergent constraint.
Because of the larger uncertainties for the Fig. 1 results, the Nature
editors suggested, and we agree, that a Retraction is the appropriate
course of action.
We note that the issues we raise here do not affect the results pre-
sented in Figs. 2, 3 or 4, or the constraint provided by the convergence
between the updated satellite-based estimates of the sensitivity of
global photosynthesis to CO and that derived from the ensemble of
2
dynamic global vegetation models. Despite the revised uncertain-
ties, we anticipate that our analysis will provide a valuable estimate
of the effect of CO on global photosynthesis. The revised paper, with
2
these issues corrected and the associated uncertainties revised, will be
submitted to another journal. The Retraction record will be updated
to contain a link to the new publication, if and when it is published.
We thank Pierre Friedlingstein and Catherine Morfopoulos for bring-
ing these issues to our attention, and are grateful for their open and
detailed feedback.

The authors are retracting this article [1], because of
errors in the data that undermine the conclusions of the
study. The errors, which were discovered during a follow-
up study, resulted from the data-searching methods used
and a problem with a computer program.

OPEN Retraction: Heavy metal removal
from MSS fly ash by thermal and
chlorination treatments
Jingyong Liu, Jiacong Chen & Limao Huang
Scientific Reports 5:17270; doi: 10.1038/srep17270; published online 25 November 2015; updated on 16 January
2017
The authors cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results and conclusions in this Article and wish to retract it.
The choice of chlorination reagents used in the experiments was inappropriate. The chlorinating agents used
included NaCl, FeCl• 6HO, MgCl• 6HO, AlCl and CaCl but in order to accurately compare results, all the
3 2 2 2 3 2
reagents used should have been hydrous or anhydrous chlorinating agents. During thermal treatment, hydrous
chlorination reagents decompose and the crystallization water will become water vapour which may react with
volatile metal chlorides and form higher stable oxides, which affects the distribution of heavy metals.
The treatment times used (3 h, 4 h, and 5 h) are too long and therefore not representative of real-world conditions
used for the removal of heavy metals by incineration with fly ash.
The XRD analysis failed to take account of the complexity of the fly ash matrix, including minerals, heavy metals
and other elements. The mineral phases are inaccurate and require further in-depth analysis.
Figure 6 is mislabeled. (a) “0% chlorination agent” should read “10% FeCl”; (b) “10% CaCl” should read “10%
3 2
AlCl ”; (d) “10% NaCl” should read “10% CaCl ”; (e) “10% FeCl ” should read “10% NaCl”; (f) “10% AlCl ”
3 2 3 3
should read “0% chlorination agent”.

This code was developed to validate the statistical figures reported in KJA21212. We
can confirm that this output was consistently reproducible using R software on both a
personal computer (R 4.2.1) and the Google Colaboratory cloud-based Jupyter
Notebook (R 4.3.1). Under the supervision of Sang Gyu Kwak (Statistical editor of
KJA), Younsuk Lee (Editor-in-Chief of KJA) developed this code, and both individuals
thoroughly verified the accuracy of the output.

Retraction of: Scientific Reports https://d oi.o rg/1 0.1 038/s 41598-0 18-2 3637-3, published online 28 March 2018
The authors are retracting this article.
After the publication of the article, J. Gottfried and H. Cigler brought to our attention that the results of the
permutation tests for contaminated data in the explorative part of the study were incorrect. We checked the
program used in the present study (and recommended by us to be used in future studies) to find out that it
has illogically coded infected (0) and uninfected (1) individuals. Due to this error, our explanation of why the
CMV-infected subjects have on average higher intelligence than the CMV-free subjects (due to contamination
of the later subset with false-negative individuals with old infections and therefore very low levels of both anti-
CMV antibodies and intelligence) was wrong. Therefore, the results of our permutation tests falsify, rather than
support, the suggested model.
Based on these facts, we retract the article and suggest that future studies search for another explanation of the
observed paradox of higher intelligence of CMV-infected subjects. We also recommend, whenever possible, to
substitute the old version of our program Treept which was not user-friendly with other programs, e.g. with our
new and more complex program for computing permutation tests for contaminated data1.
Veronika Chvátalová, Blanka Šebánková, Petr Tureček, and Jaroslav Flegr agree with this retraction and its word-
ing. Hana Hrbáčková did not respond to correspondence from the Editors about this retraction.

In this Letter, we reported electrical measurements and numerical
simulations of hybrid superconducting–semiconducting nanow-
ires in a magnetic field. We reported plateaus in the conductance at
2e2/h, which we interpreted as evidence for the presence of Majorana
zero-modes. However, several inconsistencies were pointed out by
Sergey Frolov and Vincent Mourik between the raw measurement data
that was made available to them and the figures that were published
in the paper. We therefore re-analysed all the existing raw data for our
original measurements and rebuilt the original experimental set-up
for a re-calibration of the conductance values. We established that the
data in two of the figures (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4b) had been
unnecessarily corrected for charge jumps (corrections that were not
mentioned explicitly in the paper), and that one of the figure axes was
mislabelled (Fig. 4b). The new conductance calibration shifted the
plateau values by 8 per cent, above 2e2/h, which affects all the figures1.
When the data are replotted over the full parameter range, including
ranges that were not made available earlier, points are outside the
2-sigma error bars. We can therefore no longer claim the observation
of a quantized Majorana conductance, and wish to retract this Let-
ter. After informing Nature of this decision, Nature issued an Editorial
Expression of Concern2 and initiated the retraction process. In ref. 1
we provide all the raw data underlying the published figures as well

published online 31 October 2018.
Shortly after publication, arising from comments from Nicholas Lewis,
we realized that our reported uncertainties were underestimated owing
to our treatment of certain systematic errors as random errors. In
addition, we became aware of several smaller issues in our analysis
of uncertainty. Although correcting these issues did not substantially
change the central estimate of ocean warming, it led to a roughly four-
fold increase in uncertainties, significantly weakening implications for
an upward revision of ocean warming and climate sensitivity. Because
of these weaker implications, the Nature editors asked for a Retraction,
which we accept. Despite the revised uncertainties, our method remains
valid and provides an estimate of ocean warming that is independent
of the ocean data underpinning other approaches. The revised paper,
with corrected uncertainties, will be submitted to another journal. The
Retraction will contain a link to the new publication, if and when it is
published.

Chair of Trustees Governance Statement
MCB University Press Retirement & Death Benefit Scheme ('the
Scheme')
The Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Administration) Regulations 1996 (“the
Administration Regulations”) require the Trustees to prepare an annual statement regarding
governance, which should be included in the annual report.
This statement issued by the Trustees covers the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December
2019 and is signed on behalf of the Corporate Trustees by the Chair.
This statement covers governance and charge disclosures in relation to the following:
1. The Default Arrangement,
2. Processing of core financial transactions,
3. Member borne charges and transaction costs,
4. Value for Members assessment, and
5. Trustee knowledge and understanding.
1. The Default Arrangement
The Corporate Trustee are responsible for investment governance, this includes the Corporate
Trustee reviewing the default arrangement remains in the best interests of the members.
When the Scheme was originally established the Corporate Trustee took professional advice and
selected a pension scheme where the With-Profits Fund was the only available investment fund
option available to members. This was originally with Friends Life, who were acquired by Aviva Life
& Pensions UK Limited (Aviva) in 2015, all policies, assets and liabilities of Friends Life were
transferred and completed by 1 October 2017.
The fund is now called the Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited With-Profits Sub-fund. There are two
main types of With-Profit policies in the Sub-Fund, of which for this scheme, it is invested in the
Conventional With-Profits fund.
It is the responsibility of the Aviva Board to ensure that Aviva manages the Sub-Fund in line with
the Principles and Practices set out in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management
(PPFM). Full details of the Aviva With-Profits Sub-Fund are recorded in the Aviva PPFM which can
be found on the following link: aviva.co.uk/ppfm/#fp-with-profits
In summary the key points to note in relation to the Conventional With-Profits Fund are as follows:
i. Aviva rate the With-Profits Sub-Fund as a low to medium volatility fund.
ii. The Sub-Fund aims for longer-term growth by investing in a broad range of assets.
iii. The value of the Sub-Fund can go up as well as down depending on the returns of the
underlying mix of assets within the Sub-Fund.
iv. Aviva share out the profits and losses of the Sub-Fund through a system of bonuses, with
the aim of smoothing the returns of the With-Profits investment over the long term.
v. Smoothing helps to reduce some of the significant ups and downs of investing in the stock
market. The fund aims to smooth the rises and falls in value by holding back some of the
investment returns in good years, these investment returns are then used to top up bonuses
in poor investment years.

Aon UK Limited
vi. Aviva may add regular bonuses, if any, once a year to the guaranteed amount.
Conventional With-Profits policies can receive two types of regular bonus, which are added
on top of the initial guaranteed amount. This is calculated as:
• A proportion of the initial guaranteed amount; and
• A proportion of any bonuses Aviva have added previously.
Once the above regular bonus has been added, Aviva guarantee that the regular bonus
will be paid at the policyholders chosen retirement date, the policy's maturity date or on
death.
The Corporate Trustee consider the Conventional With-Profits Fund to be appropriate for the
Scheme based on the investment strategy review which has been undertaken by the Corporate
Trustee advisers, Aon UK Limited (Aon). However, there are no alternative investment strategies
that the Corporate Trustee could utilise. The main concern is that there is no ‘de-risking’ element;
however, as the Conventional With-Profit Fund uses a ‘smoothing’ feature the risk profile remains
appropriate for the membership profile, as the majority of members have guaranteed annuity rates
and also the fund has an underlying guarantee of 3% annually.
The latest Statement of Investment Principles (SIP) which governs decisions about the default
arrangement is included in the appendix of this statement. This is based on data as at 31 December
2018. The Trustees must review the default arrangement again within the next three years.
2. Processing of Core Financial Transactions
The Corporate Trustee has a duty to ensure that core financial transactions are processed promptly
and accurately. The law specifies that these include the following:
▪ Investment of contributions to the Scheme;
▪ Transfer of member assets into and out of the Scheme;
▪ Payments from the Scheme to, or in respect of, members/beneficiaries; and
▪ Transfers between different investments within the Scheme
The Corporate Trustee must ensure that these important financial transactions are processed
promptly and accurately. In practice the Corporate Trustees delegate responsibility for this to the
Scheme administrator, Aviva. The Scheme renewal is 1 January, where both salary and
contributions are updated by the Corporate Trustee Limited with Aviva. The Scheme is set up on a
Level Direct Debit which means that the monthly payment is automatically collected on the 1st of
each month.
The Scheme administrator, Aviva will provide annual audit information on request from the
Corporate Trustee. Aviva have confirmed for the Scheme year all contributions were correct and
invested on the date of receipt.
Aviva have stated that they do not have any specific timescales for resolving or processing member
requests, as they deal with each enquiry on an individual basis. However, Aviva have stated that
they endeavour to provide members with accurate information promptly and in full.
There are no material administration service issues or complaints received in the last Scheme year,
which need to be reported here by the Corporate Trustee. The Corporate Trustee is confident that
the processes and controls in place with the administrator are robust and will ensure that the
financial transactions are dealt with properly.
Based on the above, the Corporate Trustee consider that the requirements for processing core
financial transactions have been met.

3. Member Borne Charges and Transaction costs
The Corporate Trustee monitors the level of charges borne by members through the Conventional
With-Profits Fund. The charges comprise of:
▪ explicit charges, such as an Annual Management Charge (AMC) and additional expenses that
are disclosed by the fund managers as part of the Total Expense Ratio (TER);
▪ transaction costs borne with the fund for activities such as buying and selling of particular
securities within the fund's portfolio.
Aviva have confirmed that the following charges apply to the Scheme:
▪ 0.55% Fund Administration Cost
▪ 0.039% Total Transaction Cost (This is the total of the 'Buying and Selling' costs and
'Lending and Borrowing' costs*)
*Where it is an internal fund, which is a fund managed to an investment mandate set by Aviva UK
Insurance, these are the costs incurred in buying and selling units in the Aviva insured fund and the
costs incurred by this fund in buying and selling its holdings. Where the Aviva insured fund invests
in an external fund these are the annual costs incurred in buying and selling units in the underlying
external fund and the annual costs incurred by the underlying fund in buying and selling its holdings.
From 6 April 2018, the Corporate Trustee is also required to produce an illustration of the cumulative
effect of the costs and charges on members’ retirement fund values.
Illustrations – Impact of charges:
The below sets out transactional costs and charges which apply to selected funds together with
illustrative examples of the cumulative effect of these costs and charges incurred by members.

2. The starting pot size is assumed to be £10,000 or £50,000.
3. No contributions are assumed.
4. The assumed projected growth rate for the FP With-Profits Sub-Fund in which you are invested is 3.1% per
annum.
4. Value for Members assessment
When assessing the charges and transaction costs which are payable by members, the Corporate
Trustee is required to consider the extent to which the investment options and the benefits offered
by the Scheme represent good Value for Members.
There is no legal definition of 'good value' and so the process of determining good value for
members is a subjective one. We have received advice on how to assess good value from our
advisers and considered regulatory guidance.
Together with its advisers Aon, the Corporate Trustee has established an assessment framework
in order to assess the benefits of membership of the Scheme. The framework considers the
following areas, where benefits can be financial or non-financial in nature:
Member communications
A review of member data has been carried out by the Corporate Trustee in 2019 and a tracing
exercise was completed to ensure that the Corporate Trustee holds as accurate member data as
possible.
The Scheme administrators Aviva, provide effective communications that are accurate, clear,
informative and timely. The main communication is the annual statement provided to members,
which are produced by Aviva at the end of April and issued to the trustees (via Aon) after this date.
Members have access to a number of Retirement Planning Tools, which provide online tools and
information on all Pension Freedoms and retirement planning, such as Aviva's retirement planner:
https://www.aviva.co.uk/retirement/tools/my-retirement-planner/ and Aon Retirement Service:
https://www.aonannuityfinder.co.uk. Members can also access help to support them in their
decision making by contacting Pension Wise: https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk

Investments
The Conventional With-Profits Fund is the only available investment option available to members.
However, the risk profile remains appropriate for the members in light of the overall objective of this
fund.
- The Conventional With-Profits Fund differs from a unit linked policy in that it is not totally
reliant on the current value of the underlying assets. This type of fund offers an underlying
guarantee that provides a cushion against falling investment markets in certain
circumstances. However, the value of the Sub-Fund can go up as well as down depending
on the returns of the underlying mix of assets within the Sub-Fund.
- The underlying guarantee is 3% annually applied to the members accumulated fund.
- Aviva have confirmed via the end 2019 end of year bonus update that the regular bonus
rate for 2019, applied in 2020 is 2.25% before management charges.
- As a result of demutualisation an additional value, known as the demutualisation terminal
bonus (DTB) was added to members benefits, there is a guaranteed value of the DTB at
normal retirement date or on death. The value of the DTB increases in line with a separate
rate of regular bonus Aviva declare, which can go up or down at any time, this year the rate
was 3%. Aviva may also add a final bonus to the DTB, which depends on the DTB final
bonus rates applying at that time.
- Guaranteed Annuity Rates (GAR) apply for members contributions prior to 6 April 1997 for
a male or female aged 65. For contributions after the 6 April 1997 Aviva's current annuity
rates would apply, therefore no GAR after this date. If benefits are taken at any other time
than the members normal retirement date, the rate of the GAR would be different. For
deferred members the rate of the GAR would also be different. The GAR is based on a
single life, level pension guaranteed for five years, payable monthly in advance. The GAR
would be lost if a member transferred to another pension provider.
- Tax-Free cash entitlement – if a member joined the scheme prior to 6 April 2006, the
member may be entitled to take a higher tax-free cash sum. If a member would like to check
their entitlement they can request a A-Day lump sum form from the Corporate Trustee or
Aon.
The Corporate Trustee will be reviewing the membership profile as part of the Scheme Review to
ensure that this fund continues to be suitable for the membership.
Sound administration
The Corporate Trustee has appointed Aviva to provide administration services to the Scheme and
is satisfied that Aviva has sufficient checks in place to monitor and report on the standard of the
administration service and to ensure that when administrative errors do occur, members are not
disadvantaged as a result.
This scheme is qualifying for auto enrolment.
Scheme governance
Scheme governance covers the time spent by the Corporate Trustee to ensure the Scheme is run
in compliance with the law and regulation, including taking account of the interests of its members.
The Corporate Trustee believes that good governance is key to ensuing that a framework exists
and is actively in use to help deliver better member outcomes. The Corporate Trustee review and
updates its governance processes and procedures, at least annually, to make sure that these meet
industry best standards.

A separate statement setting out the Value for Members assessment is available on request from
the Corporate Trustee’s advisers, Aon.
5. Trustees' Knowledge and Understanding
Sections 247 and 248 of the Pensions Act 2004 set out the requirement that the individuals which
represent the Corporate Trustee to have appropriate knowledge and understanding of the law
relating to pensions and trusts, the funding of Occupational Pension Schemes, investment of
scheme assets and other matters to enable them to exercise their functions as trustees properly.
This requirement is underpinned by guidance in the Pension Regulator’s Code of Practice 7.
The Corporate Trustee have met the Pension Regulator's TKU requirements (as set out under Code
of Practice No 7) during the Plan year through the following measures:
• The individuals who make up the Corporate Trustee are conversant with the Trust Deed
and Rules and the Statement of Investment Principles for the Plan. The Corporate Trustee
reverts to the legal advisor for any clarification, if required.
• The individuals who make up the Corporate Trustee have completed the Pension
Regulator’s trustee toolkit, including the modules relating to running a DC occupational
arrangement.
• Assessing training needs and considering whether any gaps exist in the individual's
knowledge and understanding.
• A training log is maintained for each individual who makes up the Corporate Trustee.
• In addition to the knowledge and understanding of the Corporate Trustee, the Corporate
Trustee has engaged with their appointed professional advisers to ensure that they run the
DC Section and exercise their functions properly, including the following:
o Reviewing the default arrangement against its overall aim and objectives with
advice from its adviser Aon;
o Initiating a review of the Scheme to ensure the current Scheme remains
appropriate in the long term for the membership.

Appendix 1
MCB University Press Retirement & Death Benefits Scheme
(the ""Scheme"") Statement of Investment Principles (the
“Statement”)
Scheme Details and Scope of Statement
This Statement has been prepared in accordance with section 35 of the Pensions Act 1995 (as
amended by the Pensions Act 2004) and the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment)
Regulations 2005 (the “Investment Regulations”).
The Scheme operates for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to eligible
participants and beneficiaries (“Members”). The Scheme is a Defined Contribution (“DC”)
pension arrangement.
The Corporate Trustee investment responsibilities are governed by the Scheme's Trust Deed
and the Statement takes full regard of its provisions. A copy of the Scheme's Trust Deed is
available, upon request.
The effective date of this Statement is July 2019, which includes the latest investment fund
information from Aviva dated 31 December 2018.
The Corporate Trustee will review this Statement at least every three years and after any
significant change in investment policy, without delay.
Consultations Made
The Corporate Trustee are responsible for the investment options made available to members
of the Scheme. When the Scheme was originally established the Corporate Trustee took
professional advice and selected a pension scheme where the Conventional With-Profits Fund
was the only investment fund option available to members.
Therefore, the Corporate Trustee are unable to make investment decisions or change the
investment funds, as the Aviva With-Profits Sub-Fund is the only investment fund available to
the Scheme.
The Corporate Trustee are also responsible for the preparation of this Statement. The
Corporate Trustee have asked their current financial adviser, Aon UK Limited (Aon), who are
authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, to draft this Statement on behalf
of the Corporate Trustee.
The Corporate Trustee consults with the employer and takes into consideration, where
appropriate, the employers comments.
The Corporate Trustee has established the following structure:
Corporate Trustee:
▪ Sets structures and processes for carrying out their role;
▪ Define and monitor investment strategy and structure;
Aon:
▪ Advises on all aspects of the investment of the Scheme assets, where required;
▪ Advises on this Statement;
Aviva, the scheme provider:
▪ Operates with the terms of this Statement and the written contract;
▪ Provides information in respect of transactions in units in the underlying funds and
valuations of the units.

Investment Principles
Corporate Trustees' aims and objectives for investment options
As mentioned earlier, when the Scheme was originally established the Corporate Trustee took
professional advice and selected a pension scheme where the Conventional With-Profits Fund
was the only available investment fund option available to members.
The key aim is to ensure that this fund remains suitable for meeting both members’ long and
short-term investment objectives. The Corporate Trustee must take into account members’
circumstances, in particular the range of members’ attitudes to risk and term to retirement.
The Corporate Trustee have reviewed the appropriateness of the Aviva With-Profits Sub-Fund;
though, the Corporate Trustee are unable to make changes to the fund or select an alternative
investment fund within the current Scheme.
Aviva have a With-Profits Committee which is a group of independent experts who help to look
after the interests of the members. The committee meets about 8 times a year and works closely
with Aviva's With-Profits Actuary and Chief Actuary and also have an independent actuarial
adviser who provides extra expertise. The Committee have 5 key objectives, which are:
1. To challenge Aviva to show that Aviva's decisions are fair to all With-Profit members,
particularly where one group is treated differently from another.
2. To check Aviva are doing what they said they would. This means keeping to Aviva's
Principles and Practices of Financial Management (PPFM), the document which sets
out Aviva's approach to managing With-Profits Funds.
3. To ensure Aviva are being fair to both new and existing With-Profits members and not
favour one group over another.
4. To help make sure Aviva send clear and complete communications to With-Profits
Members.
5. To require Aviva respond to any recommendations raised by the committee. If the
committee think Aviva have not responded properly, the committee can inform the
Financial Conduct Authority so they can follow this up.
The committee sends the minutes of its meetings to the Board. The Chair of the committee
also attends four company board meetings each year to discuss the committee's work and any
areas of concern or advice.
Aviva's PPFM is a document that sets out the principles and practices that Aviva follow when
managing its With-Profits business. The PPFM for the Aviva With-Profits Sub-Fund has been
approved by the Board of Directors of Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited ('the Board'). The
Board will report each year on whether the Aviva With-Profits Sub Fund has been managed in
accordance with the PPFM. If Aviva propose to make any material changes to any principle in
the PPFM they will inform members with a With-Profits policy in the Sub-Fund in writing at least
three months in advance, unless they consider that advanced notice is not necessary and the
FCA has agreed. The full PPFM can be found on: aviva.co.uk/ppfm/#fp-with-profits
With-Profits Sub-Fund
The Aviva With-Profits Sub-Fund is rated by Aviva as a low to medium volatility fund, there is
no recommended term of investment, but Aviva state that members should be prepared to
invest for at least 5 to 10 years.
Aviva With-Profits Sub-Fund invests in a broad range of assets and will always hold a mixture
of higher or lower risk assets to achieve its objective. It holds a greater proportion of higher risk
assets, such as shares (equities) and property (commercial). The remainder is in medium to
lower risk investments, such as gilts (loans to UK Government), corporate bonds (loans to
companies) and cash/money market.
The asset diagram below shows the type and percentage of each asset that the With-Profits
Sub-Fund invests in:

Risk Management
Within the With-Profits Sub-Fund the value of the assets will rise or fall. Members of the scheme
are invested in the Conventional With-Profits fund element of the With-Profits Sub-Fund. This
means that Aviva aim to even out some of the rises and falls in performance, which is known
as smoothing. Smoothing helps to reduce some of the significant ups and downs of investing
in the stock market. The fund aims to smooth the rises and falls in value by holding back some
of the investment returns in good years, these investment returns are then used to top up
bonuses in poor investment years. There may be times in poor market conditions when
smoothing can't fully protect members investments.
Under the Conventional With-Profits policies, bonuses are declared in two forms:
Regular Bonus
Aviva may add regular bonuses, if any, once a year to the guaranteed amount. Conventional
With-Profits policies can receive two types of regular bonus, which are added on top of the
initial guaranteed amount. This is calculated as:
• A proportion of the initial guaranteed amount; and
• A proportion of any bonuses Aviva have added previously.
Once the above regular bonus has been added, Aviva guarantee that the regular bonus will be
paid at the policyholders chosen retirement date, the policy's maturity date or on death.
Final Bonus
9DocuSign Envelope ID: 5EE539C8-46B2-456E-8BF2-1B2D2573F6D4
Aon UK Limited
The Final Bonus rates aim to pay the balance between the regular bonus already added and
the performance of the Sub-Fund over the whole period of the member's investment. This
should ensure that you get a fair share of the return the Sub-Fund has earned.
The Final Bonus is based on the year it which the member invested and the point in which the
member leaves the Sub-Fund. It may vary depending on the returns earned over the lifetime
of the member's investment and is not guaranteed.
This bonus would be normally be paid if the pension is transferred or the policy's maturity date
or on death.
Guaranteed Amount
The Conventional With-Profits Fund provides a guaranteed amount (sometimes referred to as
the 'sum assured') at maturity or on death.
Guaranteed Annuity Rates (GAR)
Some policies may have GARs, the GAR applies if benefits are taken in line with the terms of
the individual's plan conditions. This usually means that the GAR available to members at
normal retirement date will be more favourable than the rates members would get from another
pension provider at retirement. The GAR would be lost if a member transferred to another
pension provider.
Other area of risk
The other main areas of risk with this type of arrangement that the Corporate Trustee must
consider are:
▪ Volatility risk– smoothing will not protect the Conventional With-Profits Fund fully from
stock market steep or long-term falls in the value of investments. Aviva constantly
monitor investment conditions and may change levels of final bonus at any time. Final
bonuses can sometimes move up or down very significantly, even within a few months,
in spite of smoothing.
• Inflation risk – the risk that the level of inflation over members’ working lives reduces
the real level of return on the member's' investment.
• Manager risk - the risk that the chosen investment manager underperforms the
benchmark against which the investment manager is assessed. The Conventional
With-Profits Fund has an underlying guaranteed of 3% per annum.
• Unsuitability – the risk of the Conventional With-Profits Fund being unsuitable for the
requirements of some members. This is a concern to the Corporate Trustee as the
Conventional With-Profits Fund is the only available fund choice.
• Operational risk - the risk of fraud, poor advice or acts of negligence. The Corporate
Trustee have sought to minimise such risk by ensuring that all advisers and third-party
service providers are suitably qualified and experienced.
• Assets may not be readily realisable – a member may want to take benefits at a time
when a Market Value Reduction may be applied. This is a reduction that Aviva
sometimes have to make so that members who remain invested in the Sub-Fund are
not disadvantaged when other members choose to leave the fund. This could happen
if a member wishes to access their pension funds prior to the retirement date chosen
when the member policy was taken out.
Due to the complex and interrelated nature of these risks, the Corporate Trustee consider these
risks in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner as part of each formal strategy review. The
Corporate Trustee policy is to review the Conventional With-Profits Fund at least every three
years. These risks are considered as part of each normal strategy review.

Choosing Investments
The Corporate Trustee do not believe that the investment options under the Scheme provide
all members with a reasonable choice in pursuit of their individual investment objectives, as
there is only one investment option available to the members. However, the Corporate Trustee
believe that the Conventional With-Profits Fund does provide an investment option in the best
interests of most members.
Policies contain potentially valuable guarantees which members should consider in the context
of their transfer value and whether their investment remains appropriate.
Compliance
Section 36 of the Pensions Act 1995 requires that the Corporate Trustee will exercise their
powers of investment in a manner which is consistent with their investment objectives. Under
Section 36 regulation, the Corporate Trustee is required to invest the Scheme's assets in the
best interests of the members and beneficiaries. The Corporate Trustee must also ensure that
the Scheme's investments predominantly consist of assets traded on Regulated Markets, and
that they be properly diversified in a prudent manner. The assets within the Aviva With-Profits
Sub-Fund consist of assets traded on regulated markets and they are properly diversified.
The Trustees are unable to specify the asset allocation of the Aviva With-Profits Sub-Fund.
Investment manager structure
The Trustees appointed Aviva as the provider of administration services and the investment
platform to the Scheme. Aviva allow their investment manager to use derivatives (such as a
future, option or warrant) as part of an investment strategy to help manage risk or to aid efficient
portfolio management. Aviva use a range of counterparties in order to limit exposure to any
one counterparty.
Aviva manage the assets as separate asset pools by the investment manager. The target asset
allocation of the pools is regularly reviewed by the investment managers, usually every three
years or following a significant change to market conditions or the financial position of the Sub-
Fund.
Manager monitoring
Whilst the Corporate Trustee is not involved in the investment managers' day to day method of
operation and so cannot directly influence attainment of the performance target, they will assess
performance and review appointments.
Fee Structure for Investment Manager
The investment manager is remunerated as a set percentage of the assets under management.
This is in keeping with market practice. Annual investment management charges (including
other annual charges levied by the investment manager and some administration charges) are
met by the members by deduction from the unit price.
Environmental or Ethical Consideration
Unfortunately, the Corporate Trustee is unable to offer a range of funds aimed to address
environmental and ethical considerations under the current Scheme as the only fund available
under the Scheme is the Conventional With-Profits Fund.
Activism and the Exercise of the Rights Attaching to Investments (Social Responsibility)
The Corporate Trustee do not actively engage with investment managers in terms of exercising
ownership rights on socially responsible issues.
The Trustees will review from time to time the investment managers’ principles and how these
have been applied in exercising these rights. Aviva have confirmed that when investing on
behalf of members, they consider their primary objective is to achieve the best investment
return while allowing for an acceptable level of risk. In pursuing this objective, they will consider
a number of factors what will affect performance, including Socially Responsible Investment
issues.

Recently, the accuracy of one of the figures in this paper has been questioned. After careful
checking, the authors have found that their statistical analysis does have some problems. They
will perform experiments again for further data validation, but in the meantime, they have
decided to retract this paper to avoid misleading the readers of this article."

Retraction of: Scientific Reports https://d oi.o rg/1 0.1 038/s 41598-0 20-7 4060-6, published online 20 October 2020
The Authors have retracted this Article.
After publication, it was brought to the Author’s attention that there was a typo in the script used to calculate
the differential entropy. Therefore, the reported entropy estimations are invalid and do not produce the expected
increase in entropy when using the neural mass model presented in this Article. The Authors recognise this error
and apologise for the confusion it may have caused. The Authors are currently working on a corrected version
of the model, which includes the activation of the 5HT2A receptor on both excitatory and inhibitory pools; and
will test whether it reproduces the entropy increase.
All Authors agree with this retraction and its wording.

Introduction
t
Racial tensionsein America have persisted since the country’s
founding (Alexander 2012; Bell 2002; McPherson et al. 2001; Peff-
ley and HurwRitz 2010; Peterson 2017; Unnever 2014). Although
many such tensions can be identified, the “lynching era” (Tolnay
and Beck 1995: 17)—which spanned a roughly 50-year period
from around 1880 (the end of Reconstruction) to the 1930s—
stands out and has been the subject of an emerging body of
scholarship that seeks to document and understand the legacy of
lynchingsincontemporaryAmerica.
Research on lynchings has emphasized the salience of lynch-
ings for exemplifying and supporting a culture of racial animus

and hostility toward blacks that exerts a persisting influence on
race relations in contemporary America (DeFina and Hannon
2011; Durso and Jacobs 2013; Jacobs et al. 2005, 2012; King et al.
2009; Messner et al. 2005; Porter 2011; Porter et al. 2014;
Smˆangs 2016; Stewart et al. 2018). Many studies in this tradition
highlight the salience of racial threat for explaining how the racial
animus exemplified by lynchings contributes to modern-day
whites’ views about and reactions to blacks. In so doing, they par-
allel the research that employs racial threat theory to understand
racial disparities in crime policy, law enforcement, punishment,
mass incarceration, and Americans’ views aboudt blacks and crime
(see, e.g., Chiricos et al. 2004; Goidel et al. 2011; Smith and
Holmes 2003; Stults and Baumer 2007; Tonry 2012; Ulmer and
e
Laskorunsky 2016; Wang andMears 2010).
This paper seeks to contribute to scholarship aimed at under-
t
standing the historical legacy of lynchings and contemporary
racialized views of crime. To this ecnd, it examines whether lynch-
ings influence modern-day views that whites hold of blacks both
as criminals and as criminal thareats to whites. The touchstone for
this theoretical argument stems from literature on the role of
lynchings in expressing and supporting a deep-rooted cultural
r
view of blacks that persists in contemporary society and continues
to shape how whites tperceive blacks. Drawing on this work and
on racial threat theory, we hypothesize that whites who reside in
e
areas where lynchings occurred will be more likely to perceive
blacks as criminals and, more specifically, as criminal threats to
whites. We drRaw, too, on scholarship that highlights the salience
of social class and political ideology to hypothesize that residency
in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage and political conservatism
will amplify these effects. In what follows, we discuss prior theory
and research that provide the context for these hypotheses. We
then discuss the data and methods used to test them, the findings,
and their implications for scholarship.
Background
TheLegacyofLynchingsinContemporaryAmerica
The Civil War marked a turning point in the history of the
United States, one that drew attention to changing status of blacks.
Passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery,
raised questions about whites’ position in society (Acharya et al.
2016;Alexander2012;Davis2006;Feagin2013).Inresponse,dur-
ing the post-War upheaval, whites’ animosity toward blacks esca-
lated (Brundage 1993; Tolnay and Beck 1995). Lynchings—which
peaked during the 1880s and 1890s and then persisted, albeit at
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University PressMears,Stewart,Warren,Craig,&Arnio 489
increasingly lower levels, for another 50 years—constituted one of
thecentralandmostviolentresultsofthisanimosity.
Research points to a complex array of forces that led to lynch-
ings. As King et al. (2009: 294) have emphasized, the literature on
lynchings “include psychological and psychoanalytic accounts,
arguments about the reliance on popular or vigilante justice to
compensate for the perceived ineffectiveness of legal institutions,
cultural interpretations highlighting southern notions of chivalry
and honor, and ‘social threat’ accounts emphasizing the political
and economic competition between blacks and whites” (see,
e.g., Clarke 1998; King et al. 2009; Wells 197d0; Messner et al.
2006). Regardless, one consistent theme that surfaces across these
accounts is that lynchings emanated from and reflected extreme
e
racial hatred.
In efforts to understand the aftermath of lynchings, scholars
have emphasized the entrenched tand open pervasiveness of
whites’ hostility toward blacks. Mcurders of blacks frequently
occurred in the dark of night (Bailey and Tolnay 2015; Beck
2015). But they also not infrequently constituted public events,
a
ones in which no effort was made to obscure participants or their
actions. Indeed, lynchings in such instances were communal
undertakings that invorlved children and families and were
reported in news accounts (Allen 2000; Bailey and Tolnay 2015;
t
Clarke 1998; Ginzburg 1988; Litwack 2000; Pfeifer 2004; Poole
e
2009). An illustration of the overt displays of violence can be seen
in the 1908 lynching of an African American, Nelse Patton, who
had been accuRsed of killing a white woman in Oxford, Mississippi.
The lynching was overseen by an ex-U.S. Senator, William
V. Sullivan, who openly boasted about the daytime lynching,
which, notably, had occurred in the town square (Williamson
1993). Similar events unfolded elsewhere. In typical fashion,
lynchings in such cases not only were public spectacles but also
entailed gruesome violence that conveyed the profound animus
and resentment that whites felt toward blacks (Ginzburg 1988;
White 1918).
This sensibility was not isolated. Lynchings were part and par-
celof thesocialand cultural fabric of white society. When lynchings
occurred, it reflected the view among whites that it was acceptable
todoso.Italsoreflectedaviewofblacksas“inherentlyandperma-
nently inferior” and “less than human” (Litwack 2000: 12). It
reflected more than that, though. The intensity of violence against
lynching victims went well beyond what would be required to put
someone to death (Tolnay and Beck 1995; White 1918). Among
whites, a sense of rage existed that a seemingly less-than-human
group,onepreviouslyenslaved,couldoccupythesamesocialstatus
asthem(Smˆangs2016;TolnayandBeck1995;Williamson1993).
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University Press490 PerceivedBlackCriminalThreatAmongWhites
Lynchings provided, then, an expression of animus and
resentment that pervaded white society and, at the same time,
reinforced hostility toward blacks. As Markovitz (2004: xvii) has
argued, “lynchings were never entirely confined to the physical
realm and were instead always intended to be seen as a metaphor
for race relations,” and this metaphor “has resurfaced, changed,
and been deployed over time.” In this view, lynchings provided a
reflection of a broader racial tension that governed whites’ views
of blacks. The penetration of this tension in communities in turn
created the foundation for a legacy and culture of racial hatred
that could resurface in subsequent decadesd(Carrigan 2004;
Clarke 1998; Durso and Jacobs 2013; Frazier 2015; Gabriel and
Tolnay 2017). King et al. (2009: 292) have, for example, argued
e
that the “racial antagonism” embodied by lynchings “tends to be
deeply ingrained in culture (i.e., it dies hard),” and thus continue
to influencemodernracial dynamics.t
c
LynchingsandContemporaryWhites’ViewsofBlackCriminal
Threat a
One such resurfacing can be seen in get-tough criminal justice
policies that have disprroportionately affected blacks. Scholars
argue that these policies have resulted in part from a contempo-
t
rary fear of blacks as criminal threats (Alexander 2012; Pettit and
e
Western 2004; Unnever and Gabbidon 2011). Some studies have
directly linked the policies to lynchings. Jacobs et al. (2012: 170),
for example,Rhave written that “the intense anti-Black fervor
exemplified by [lynchings] may persist in sufficient strength to
influence contemporary legal punishments.” Similarly, King et al.
(2009: 293) have argued that the “symbolic and cultural frame-
work surrounding lynching” can help to explain current sanction-
ing policies and practices. Support for this argument can be
found in an emerging and diverse body of research that has
found a positive association between past lynchings and contem-
porary capital punishment, prison admissions, noncompliance
with federal hate crime law, violence toward blacks, and white
supremacist group activity (DeFina and Hannon 2011; Durso and
Jacobs 2013; Jacobs et al. 2005, 2012; King et al. 2009; Messner
et al. 2006; Petersen and Ward 2015; Porter 2011; Porter
et al. 2014).

and Hurwitz 2010; Pickett et al. 2012; Unnever 2014; Wang and
Mears2010).
e
Building on this theoretical tradition, a number of studies
have explored how lynchings—and the culturally embedded
racial animus that they represent—tcontribute to hostile and
punitive actions toward blacks inccontemporary America, such
as limited hate crime enforcement (King et al. 2009), increased
participation in white supremacist groups (Durso and Jacobs
a
2013), and greater support for capital punishment (Messner
et al. 2006) and for punitive sanctions of black offenders in
particular (Stewart et alr. 2018). These studies suggest that the
legacy of lynching can be seen in violence toward blacks and in
t
efforts to impose punishments. Such responses have been
e
interpreted through the lens of racial threat theory. The legacy
entails persistent racial animosity that in modern times finds
expression noRt only in anti-black sentiment but also in concern
about blacks as presenting a criminal threat (Tolnay and Beck
1995: 17). This idea can readily be seen in analyses of support
for the death penalty. Whites who reside in areas where lynch-
ings occurred are more likely to support the death penalty
(Messner et al. 2006), which logically implies a concern among
whites about blacks as sources of crime. The idea can be seen
as well in white supremacist group participation; itself an effort
to exercise informal social control. For example, Durso and
Jacobs (2013: 129) have emphasized that “supremacist rhe-
toric” emphasizes a concern about violent crime committed by
blacks.
These lines of work lend support to racial threat arguments
about the effects of lynchings.1 The consistent theme that emerges
is that deeply rooted racial animus has persisted over time. In
addition, this animus has shaped modern-day whites’ views about

blacks and punitive sanctions, especially those that may serve to
control or punish blacks. Research has emphasized more than a
global perception of racial threat. It suggests that lynchings have
contributed to views among whites that blacks present a potent
criminal threat to society and, beyond that, a criminal threat spe-
cifically to whites (see, e.g., Durso and Jacobs 2013; King et al.
2009; Stewart et al. 2018). Not least, scholarship on lynchings and
racial threat underscores the potential for threat mechanisms to
be amplified by social context (see, generally, DeFina and Hannon
2011; Gabriel and Tolnay 2017; Jackson 1989; Jacobs et al. 2012;
Mears et al. 2016; Welch et al. 2011). d
StudyQuestionsandHypotheses e
In this study, we seek to contribute to efforts to understand
the salienceof lynchingsandthe raciatlizationofcrimebothhistor-
ically and in contemporary Amercica. To this end, we draw on
prior theory and empirical research to develop and test two inter-
related hypotheses.
a
First, perceived black criminal threat—that is, the perception that blacks
are criminal and that they are more likely to commit crimes against whites—
willbegreateramongwhiteswrhoresideinareasthatexperiencedhighernum-
bers of lynchings (H1). This hypothesis derives from scholarship that
t
hasidentified“lingeringeffects”oflynchings(Morrison2006;Porter
e
2011) and highlights the potential for lynchings to influence how
whites in contemporary America view blacks as criminal threats (e.-
g., Jacobs et alR. 2012; King et al. 2009; Messner et al. 2006). This
line of research suggests that whites who reside in areas where
lynchings,inthepast,weremorefrequentwillbemorelikelytoreg-
istergreater levels of perceived black criminal threat and, in particu-
lar, that they will be more likely to view blacks as a criminal threat to
whites.
Second, in contemporary America, this effect will be more pronounced
among whites who reside in areas marked by greater social and economic
disadvantage (H2a) or areas that are politically conservative (H2b).
Hypothesis 2a incorporates insights that scholars have made
about the potential for the effect of racial threat to be greater in
areas where the majority, whites, may be more likely to live on the
social or economic margins. They face a greater risk of exclusion
from mainstream society or of failing to conform with conven-
tional middle-class views of success and belonging (Byrd et al.
2015;DursoandJacobs2013;FullertonandDixon2009;Thompson
2016). Asaresult,whitesinsuchareasmay experience higherlevels

competition with blacks (see, e.g., Hochschild 2016; see, generally,
Wells 1970). This social context in turn may contribute to whites’
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University PressMears,Stewart,Warren,Craig,&Arnio 493
animosity toward blacks and related concernsabout blacks as posing
a threat to the safety and order of mainstream society. At the same
time, the effect of lynchings—and the anti-black animosity that such
lynchings represented—may be amplified among whites who reside
in disadvantaged areas. Such individuals may be more likely to view
blacks as a criminal threat and as a threat that may directly
affectthem.
Therootsof this potentially moreacutelyfelt threathavetheir
foundation in the aftermath of the Civil War. Tolnay and Beck
(1995: 4) have observed, for example, that southern whites faced
greater competition for employment and in thisdsense “were casu-
alties of war.” For example, from 1900 to 1930, the number of
black tenant farmers in the South increased by 27 percent. This
e
increase contributed to higher unemployment and economic dis-
advantage among rural whites. As a result, mob violence and
lynchings were used as an organizetd method to displace black
workers who represented a threatcto whites’ economic well-being
(Raper 2003). Scholars have documented the economic competi-
tion that arose as blacks migrated north during the early part of
a
the twentieth century and were perceived as economic competi-
tors to whites, in turn resulting in exclusionary practices against
blacks (Horowitz 1985;rLieberson 1981; Olzak 1992; Wilson
1996). In contemporary America, however, disadvantage may
t
exert effects that go beyond activating perceptions among whites
e
about competition with blacks that in turn fuels resentment or
antipathy toward them (Tolnay and Beck 1995). It also may fuel
defeatism, frusRtration, and a broader sense, as Hochschild (2016)
has described, “of being shoved back in line” while others get
ahead (215), as amounting to “strangers in their own land” (219),
and as being “culturally marginalized” (221). Social and economic
disadvantage thus may provide a context that provides multiple
grounds for amplifying whites’ racial animus and hostility toward
blacks. In so doing, it provides a setting in which the legacy of
lynchings may resonate more strongly and thus amplify percep-
tions of blacksas criminalthreats to whites.
Hypothesis 2b extends this line of reasoning and draws on lit-
erature that finds that political conservatives may be more likely to
endorse punitive views grounded in opposition to or fear of blacks
(Chiricos et al. 2004; Fullerton and Dixon 2009; Jacobs et al. 2012;
King 2008; McCorkle 1993). Specifically, conservatives are more
likely to campaign on law-and-order platforms and support puni-
tive policies that disproportionately affect blacks and other minori-
ties (Beckett 1997; Davey 1998; Jacobs and Helms 1996; McVeigh
et al. 2014; Stucky et al. 2005). Indeed, conservative rhetoric about
law and order have been used historically and in contemporary
times toincreasepublic awareness ofcrime and punishmentand to

link street crime to blacks (Alexander 2012; Beckett 1997; Beckett
and Sasson 2000; Campbell and Schoenfeld 2013; Chiricos et al.
2004;Garland2001;Hawkins1987;Ward2015).
Some scholars have observed that associating crime with race
provides an avenue through which Republican presidential candi-
datesandadministrationscanappealtoworkingandlowermiddle-
class whites (Beckett 1997; Jacobs and Helms 1996; McVeigh et al.
2014).Forexample,Beckett (1997)and Beckett and Sasson(2000)
have observed that the Reagan and Bush administrations empha-
sized a political discourse centered on exclusion of marginalized
populations.Thisdiscourseledtoaviewofminodritiesandthepoor
as potent threats to social order, a phenomenon that has persisted
in subsequent elections (Hochschild 2016; Ramirez 2013). Collec-
e
tively, such work suggests that in politically conservative communi-
ties, whites may be more likely to perceive blacks as criminal
threats. Morerelevant toour focus,hotwever, itsuggeststhatpoliti-
cal conservatism may provide an idceological context that amplifies
the effects of a historical legacy of anti-black sentiment. We thus

r
Data and Methods
t
e
To test the hypotheses, we constructed a multilevel database
using individual level survey data and county-level contextual pre-
dictors. The iRndividual level data for the study were gathered
through a national random telephone survey of 2736 American
adults age 18 or older, using random-digit dialing and Computer
Assisted Telephone Interviewing to ensure accuracy in recording
data.Thesamplingframeincludeshouseholdswitheitherlandlines
or cellular phones; households without either form of telecommu-
nication may be underrepresented. The telephone surveys were
conducted throughout 2013. The survey focused on respondents’
attitudes about crime and punishment and collected information
on whites’ views about black criminals; it thus offers a unique
opportunitytoexamineourresearchquestions.
A two-stage modified Mitofsky-Waksberg sampling design was
used to develop the random-digit dialing sample (Tourangeau
2004). Respondents were limited to one adult resident per house-
hold. From each household sampled, the adult respondent with
the most recent birthday was selected (Kish 1965). Trained inter-
viewers conducted the telephone interviews and were closely
monitored by supervisors. In addition, to minimize interviewer
error, supervisors reviewed 10 percent of completed interviews
foraccuracybycomparingselectedresponsestodigitallyrecorded
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University PressMears,Stewart,Warren,Craig,&Arnio 495
excerpts of interviews. There was 93 percent agreement between
supervisors and interviewers; in the 7 percent of cases where
there was not agreement, the supervisors and interviewers met to
reconcile the discrepancy. A five call-back rule was employed
before replacement of households. Using the definition recom-
mended by the American Association for Public Opinion Research
(AAPOR 2008)—that is, completed calls divided by the sum of
completed calls, terminated calls, and refusals—we obtained a 61
percent response rate among all contacts with eligible respon-
dents. Cases of unknown eligibility, such as answering machines,
busy signals, no answer, and known ineligibilidty, such as discon-
nected numbers, businesses, and fax numbers, were excluded
from this calculation. The response rate is comparable to studies
e
that use rigorous survey methodologies (McCarty et al. 2006; Pew
Research Center 2004), as well as those in similar studies
(e.g., King and Wheelock 2007). Ovetrall, 94 percent of all surveys
initiated were completed; this ratecis substantially higher than the
60 percent average for national telephone interviews (see, gener-
ally, Weisberg et al. 1989).
a
We restricted the analyses to the 2408 non-Latino white
respondents in the sample; these respondents were distributed
across 168 counties. Therracial and ethnic background of the origi-
nal samplewasas follows: 88 percentof thesample was non-Latino
t
white, 7 percent was black, 3 percent was Latino, and 2 percent
e
was Asian. Since our primary interest is in how the dominant
group, in this case whites, views blacks, we restricted the sample to
non-Latino whRite respondents. To account for the potential influ-
ence of contextual characteristics, we geocoded respondents to the
168 counties where they resided and appended to the individual
level records county-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We
employed modern county boundaries to link lynching counts to
theidentifyingcodesusedbytheCensusBureau.
Twosetsofdatawereanalyzed.First,thesouthernsamplecomes
fromBeckandTolnay’s(2015)southerninventory.Itincludeslynch-
ing data for 11 southern states from 1877 through 1950: Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia (see also Tolnay
et al. 1996). The analyses rely on these data both because lynchings
occurred primarily in the South (Brundage 1993) and because of
thewell-establishedvalidityoftheBeckandTolnay(2015)inventory.
In total, for the southern sample, there are 1301 respondents across
79countiesinthese11states.
Second, in addition to analysis of the southern sample, we rep-
licated the analyses using a national sample to assess the robustness
of the results. The national sample consists of 2408 respondents
who resided in 168 counties across 38 states. In creating the
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University Press496 PerceivedBlackCriminalThreatAmongWhites
national data file, we augmented the Beck and Tolnay (2015)
inventory using data from several scholars and organizations. One
source comes from Pfeifer’s (2004, 2013) lynching inventories.
Thesespannedtheyearsfrom1870to1947andprovidedlynching
data for counties in the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Another source is Frazier’s (2009, 2015) lynching inventories,
which covered the years 1870–1932 for Kansas counties and 1870–
1950 for Missouri counties. For counties in Maryland, we drew on
the lynching inventory, for 1870–1933, from tdhe Maryland State
Archives (2017). Leonard (2002) provided lynching inventory data
for Colorado counties for 1870–1919. Carrigan (2004) provided
e
lynching inventory data for Texas counties for 1870–1916. Kiktode
(2008) provided lynching inventory data for Oklahoma counties
for 1870–1930. The National Associattion for the Advancement of
Colored People’s (NAACP 1919) lcynching inventory, 1889–1918,
was used to obtain lynching data for counties in Connecticut,
Massachusetts,NewMexico,andRhodeIsland.
a
Time spans covered by the different data sources varied.
Accordingly, we computed annualized lynching counts by dividing
total lynching counts forrby the number of years covered by each
data source. To illustrate, the Beck and Tolnay (2015) lynching
t
totals were divided by 73 (i.e., the number of years encompassed
e
between 1877 and 1950) and the Pfeifer (2004, 2013) lynching
totals were divided by 77 (1870–1947). This procedure was fol-
lowed for eachRlynching inventory (see also King et al. 2009: 297).
Thisapproachallowsforinvestigationof thepeakeraof lynchings
(Tolnay and Beck 1995: 30) and whether any effect of lynching
observed in the southern sample can be replicated in the national
sample of counties. More generally, by merging the lynching and
survey data, we are able to examine whether racial animus over
100 years ago, as reflected in lynchings, affects contemporary
whites’ attitudes of black criminal threat. We can investigate, too,
whether this relationship is moderated by contemporary county-
level concentrated disadvantageand political context, respectively.
Below we describe each of the variables used in the study.

these processes invoelve concerns that whites have about blacks as
posing a criminal threat in general or as a criminal threat to whites
in particular. These studies, however, have not directly examined
R
whites views of black criminality or, by extension, whether whites
view blacks as posing a direct criminal threat to them. To address
this research gap, we examine two dependent variables that accord
with those used in prior studies that assess racial and ethnic threat
processes (see, e.g., Barkan and Cohn 1994, 2005; King and Whee-
lock 2007; Stults and Baumer 2007; Johnson et al. 2011): Perceived
blackcriminalthreatandperceivedblack-on-whitecrime.
Black criminal threat is measured using responses to six state-
ments: blacks “pose a greater threat to public order and safety
than other racial or ethnic groups; hurt the U.S. by committing
more violent crimes than other racial or ethnic groups; hurt the
U.S. by committing more property crimes than other racial or
ethnic groups; hurt the U.S. by committing more drug crimes
than other racial or ethnic groups; commit most of the crime in
the United States; commit crimes that are more harmful to society
when compared to other racial or ethnic groups.” Response cate-
gories were: 0 = strongly disagree, 1 = disagree, 2 = agree, and
3 = strongly agree. The resulting measure ranges from 0 (low)
through 18(high) andthe alpha coefficient for it was .86.
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University Press498 PerceivedBlackCriminalThreatAmongWhites
Black-on-white crime is measured using five statements: blacks
“commit most of the violent crimes against law-abiding Whites
than any other racial or ethnic groups; commit most of the prop-
erty crimes against law-abiding Whites than any other racial or
ethnic groups; target law-abiding Whites for victimization more
than any other racial or ethnic groups; pose a greater criminal
threat to law-abiding Whites than any other racial or ethnic
groups; commit most of the crimes in the U.S. against law-abiding
Whites than any other racial or ethnic groups.” Response catego-
ries rangedfrom 0 = stronglydisagreeto 3= strongly agree.
This measure had an alpha coefficient of .8d3 and values that
ranged from 0 (low) to 15 (high). To assess whether the black
criminal threat and black-on-white crime measures were empiri-
e
cally distinct from each other, we estimated both an exploratory
factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. The analyses
showed that perceived black criminaltthreat and perceived black-
on-white crime were moderately ccorrelated (r = .58) and thus
cannot be collapsed into a single factor without significant loss of
information. In short, the two reflect distinct constructs that are
a
empirically distinguishable.
r
IndependentVariable
t
Our main theoretical variable is black lynchings, as a measure
e
of racial animus and hostility among whites in the late 1800s and
early 1900s. It is the number of lynching events with at least one
black victim foRr the years covered in the data sources, and is a
measure used in similar studies of lynching (e.g., King et al. 2009;
Messner et al. 2005; Tolnay and Beck 1995). We estimated the
number rather than rate of lynchings because the symbolic mean-
ing of lynching is unlikely to be a function of proportionate repre-
sentation. Lynchings occurred rarely; in many cases, though
certainly not all, when they did occur, they were publicized and
involved entire communities (King et al. 2009; Litwack 2000;
Tolnay et al. 1996; Williamson 1993). The period covered by the
sources represents the height of lynching activity in America
(Tolnay and Beck 1995: 30). Black lynchings for the main ana-
lyses, which rely on the Tolnay and Beck (1995) southern inven-
tory, rangefrom 0(low) to 36(high).
We also examine two moderating variables that we theorize
will condition the effect of lynchings. The first, concentrated disad-
vantage, is measured by three county-level 2010 decennial Cen-
sus indicators: the percentage of persons on public assistance,
the percentage of households below the poverty level, and the
percentage of persons unemployed. Other studies have used
such variables to examine social and economic disadvantage (see,
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University PressMears,Stewart,Warren,Craig,&Arnio 499
e.g., Sampson et al. 1997; Parker and Reckdenwald 2008). All
three items were standardized and combined to form a measure
of disadvantage. We then added a constant (12) to eliminate neg-
ative values; this measure ranges from 0 (low) to 11 (high) and
had an alpha coefficient of .87. The second moderator is political
conservatism, measured here as the percent voting republican. Spe-
cifically, it is the proportion of county residents voting for the
Republican Presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, in 2012. This
measure ranges from 0 (low) to 100 (high).
ControlVariables d
We controlled for a wide range of individual and county-
level factors that scholars have linked toepunitive attitudes (see,
e.g., Barkan and Cohn 1994, 2005; Baumer et al. 2003; King
and Wheelock 2007; Smith and Holmes 2003; Stults and
t
Baumer2007).Attheindividuallevel,wecontrolledforthefollow-
c
ing factors: age, gender, marital status, education level, family
income, employment status, political conservatism, homeowner-
ship, and fear of blacks. At theacounty level, controls included the
following: homicide rate, percent black, black growth, population
structure, and percent urban. We also included a spatial lag. It is
r
derived from a weighting technique that assumes that black lynch-
ings in spatially proximtate counties may influence the black lynch-
ings in a given counety. This lag gives less weight to geographically
distant counties and more to those nearby to control for the influ-
ence oflynchings inneighboring counties.TheAppendix provides

fulldetailsaboutthedefinitionsandmetricsofthesevariables.
AnalyticStrategy
We estimated multilevel linear models, with individuals nested
within counties, to examine how lynchings, concentrated disadvan-
tage,and politicalcontext are associated withwhites’perceptionsof
blacks as criminal threats. Multilevel models are useful for addres-
sing nonindependence of observations within higher order group-
ings. In our analysis, the 1301 respondents are nested within the
79 southern counties, with an average of 16 respondents per
county. Ignoring this clustering may yield standard errors that are
deflated, thus exaggerating tests of statistical significance. Specifi-
cally, residual errors are likely to be correlated within counties in
nested data. That violates the assumption of independence of
observations in regression analysis, which tends to bias standard
errors downward and increase the probability of type I (false posi-
tive)errors(RaudenbushandBryk2002).
Multilevel modeling accounts for this nonindependence and
produces correct estimates of standard errors (Raudenbush and
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University Press500 PerceivedBlackCriminalThreatAmongWhites
Bryk 2002). This technique also is useful because it allows us to
estimate a model that isolates the independent effects of both
individual and county-level variables. All models are estimated
using the multilevel function in the Stata 14 program (Rabe-
Hesketh and Skrondal 2008).2
The analyses proceed through the following steps. First, we
regressed perceived black criminal threat among whites on black
lynchings, as well as on individual and county-level control vari-
ables. Second, we build on this multilevel model by including con-
centrated disadvantage and percent voting Republican to examine
their influence on whites’ perceptions of blacks das criminal threats.
Third, we test whether the influence of black lynchings on per-
ceived black criminal threat is amplified by concentrated disadvan-
e
tage and percent voting Republican. Finally, we repeat these
analyseswithourseconddependent variable,black-on-whitecrime.
We do so to assess whether whites diffterentiate in their views about
black threat and whether, in partcicular, the legacy of lynchings
increases whites’ views of blacks not only as criminals but also as
posing,inparticular,acriminalthreattowhites.

lynchings, the associations between the control variables and per-

model, black criminal threat is higher among the non-married,

political conservatives, and those who are more fearful of blacks in
general. In adRdition, respondents in counties with greater growth
in the black population and in counties with a lower population
structure ordensityreported higher levels of perceivedblack crim-
inal threat. The black percent and growth measures were not sig-
nificant, which contrasts with some studies that have examined
views of minorities as criminal threats (see, e.g., King and Whee-
lock2007;UnneverandCullen2007;Wang2012).
We now turn to our substantive focus. Inspection of model
1 shows that the black lynchings variable is statistically significant
and is positively associated with perceived black criminal threat.
This finding suggests that, among whites in contemporary Amer-
ica, levels of perceived black criminal threat are higher in counties
where historical patterns of black lynching activities were more
frequent. To illustrate the magnitude of this relationship, we pre-
dict levels of black criminal threat that corresponded to varying
levels of lynching activity, with all covariates set at their means.
The predicted value of criminal threat for whites who resided in a
county that experienced no lynching is 7.4. By contrast, this level
rises to 10.4 for those residing in a county with 10 black lynching
victims. Thus, the legacy of a particularly high prevalence of
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University Press502 PerceivedBlackCriminalThreatAmongWhites
lynching activity increases perceived black criminal threat by
3 points, a 40 percentincrease.3
In the subsequent model, we include concentrated disadvan-
tage and percent voting Republican. The results displayed in
model 2 showed that both variables also are statistically significant
andpositivelyassociatedwithcriminalthreat.Thus,perceptionsof
black threatare greater in less prosperouscounties.4 Similarly, the
statistically significant coefficient for percent voting Republican
indicates that whites who resided in counties with more votes for
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate in the 2012
election, than for Barack Obama are more likeldy to view blacks as
criminallythreatening.
Model 2 establishes that concentrated disadvantage and percent
e
Republican are associated with whites’ viewsof black criminal threat
andprovidesthefoundationforoursecondhypothesis—examining

andpercentRepublican.Bothmodelslendsupporttothehypothe-

(b = .070 in model 3 and b = .008 in model 4). Specifically, the

As inspection of Figure 1 highlights, among whites who reside
in highly disadvantaged areas, the effects of living in areas that
experienced more lynchings is greater. For these individuals, resi-
dency in communities that had a greater number of lynchings
substantially increases their perceptions of blacks as a criminal
threat, and does so considerably more than it does among whites
in areas of greater socioeconomic advantage. A similar pattern
surfaces among whites residing in Republican strongholds versus
those who do not, as can be seenin Figure2.
To this point, our focus has centered on whites’ perceptions of
blacks as a criminal threat. This focus is, however, diffused and does
not address the possibility of a more targeted effect, such that whites
perceiveblacksasacriminalthreattowhitesinparticular.Atargeted
effect is anticipated by scholarship on lynchings, which highlight the
animosity that whites felt toward blacks and that was expressed
through violence against blacks (Tolnay and Beck 1995). It is antici-
pated, too, by scholarship on racial threat, which anticipates that
whites may be more likely to view blacks as criminals and as likely to
harm them (Mears et al. 2013). In short, the question arises: Does
residing in areas where racial animus and hostility were greater

increase the probability that contemporary whites who reside in
these areas will view blacks as likely to commit crimes specifically
againstwhites?Table3answersthisquestionbyrevisitingthemodels
above and focusing on our second outcome—perceptions among
whitesthatblacksaremorelikelytocommitcrimesagainstwhites.
As can be seen in Table 3, a similar pattern of results surfaces
to that in Table 2. In model 1, as expected, the results indicate that
lynchings havea statistically significant and positive effect on whites
perceptions of black-on-white crime. This finding indicates that
whites who resided in counties with a historical legacy of racial vio-
lence express a heightened belief that blacks pose a criminal threat
specifically against them. To illustrate, the predicted value of black-
on-whitecrimeforwhiteswhoresidedinacountythatexperienced
no lynchings is 6. This level rises 2.8 points, a 47 percent increase,
for those residing in a county with 10 black lynching victims. The
legacy of lynching thus not only increases whites’ perceptions of
blacks as criminals but it also increases their perceptionsthat blacks
poseadirectcriminalthreattothem.
Here, again, consistent with the above analyses, concentrated
disadvantage and percent voting Republican were statistically signifi-
cant predictors of black criminal threat and, in particular, perceived
threat of black-on-white crime (model 2). Of particular relevance for
our second hypothesis, models 3 and 4 indicate that disadvantage

amplified,too, by residingin areas thathave a strongerRepublican
base.Inshort,theresultssuggestthattheeffectsofhistoricallynch-
ings,includingtheamplifyingeffectsofcontemporaryconcentrated

We turn, finally, to an analysis that examined whether the
results differed for black respondents. The theoretical logic of the
study suggests that lynching effects on perceptions about black
criminal threat should arise only for whites, dnot for blacks. To
investigate this prediction, we estimated models consistent with
those in Tables 2 and 3 but focused instead on black respondents
e
(n = 200). Black lynchings did not yield a statistically significant
effect on black criminal threat or black-on-white crime. The ana-
lyses thus suggestthat, as anticipated,tlynchingsmay be influential
in shapingwhites’, not blacks’, viewcsof black criminalthreat.
Conclusion a
The lineage of racial tensions in America can be traced to many
r
factors, not least of which is the enslavement of Africans during the
country’s formation. Tthroughout the 1800s, blacks were viewed by
many whites as less than human and, by extension, as occupying a
e
social position well below that of whites. During the latter half of the
nineteenth century, calls to provide blacks greater legal rights chal-
R
lenged this view. In so doing, they created the foundation for racial
animus and hostility toward blacks that—through a “cultural and
symbolic framework” (Kinget al. (2009: 293) built on anti-blacksen-
timent (Jacobs et al. (2012)—scholars have argued has persisted into
modern times (Messner et al. 2006; Gabriel and Tolnay 2017; see,
generally, Alexander 2012; Unnever 2014). Arguably, the most vivid
expression of hostility came in the form of lynchings in the late
1800sandearly1900s(Ginzburg1988;TolnayandBeck1995).
Building on scholarship on lynchings and racial threat theory,
we sought to extend efforts to understand the potentially enduring
effects of lynchings and the culture from which they emanated
(e.g.,DeFinaandHannon2011;Jacobsetal.2005,2012; Kingetal.
2009; McVeigh and Cunningham 2012; Messner et al. 2005; Tolnay
5 Wealsoexaminedlynchingeffectsforcountieslocatedonlyinnorthernstates.A
similar pattern ofresults asthosepresented inthe tables surfaced. For example, lynch-
ings (p < .05) predicted perceived black criminal threat (b = .094, s.e. = .043) and
black-on-whitecriminalthreat(b=.127,s.e.=.060).Theseresultssuggestthatthemain
findings are not solely driven by southern counties and instead reflect a more general

et al. 1996). At the same time, we sought to extend scholarship
aimed at understanding why whites in contemporary America may
equate blacks with criminality (Alexander 2012; Barkan and Cohn
2005; Chiricos et al. 2004; Pettit and Western 2004). To this end, we
drew on prior theory and research to hypothesize that perceived
racial threat would be greater among whites who resided in areas
that had a more entrenched legacy of lynchings. We hypothesized,
too, that this effect would be greater among whites who resided in
areasofgreatersocialandeconomicdisadvantageorpoliticalconser-
vatism. Such areas, we argued, provide conditions within which the
culturallegacyandeffectsoflynchingsmaybemodstlikelytoflourish
andthusanimatewhites’perceptionsofblacksasacriminalthreatin
generalandtowardwhitesinparticular.
e
Analyses of contemporary public opinion data and historical
lynching data lent support to both hypotheses. Whites who reside
in communities with a greater histotrical legacy of racial animus
and hostility, as reflected in and pcerpetuated by higher levels of
lynchings, were more likely to view blacks as a threat. Specifically,
whites from such areas were more likely to view blacks as criminal
a
threats and to view blacks as more likely to commit crimes against
whites. The perceived threat thus was not just that blacks are
more criminal but also trhat whites are likely to be the victims of
black criminal activity. In addition, the analyses indicated that, as
t
hypothesized, these effects were more pronounced among whites
e
residing in areas of greater socioeconomic disadvantage and in
more politically conservative communities.
Several imRplications of these findings warrant emphasis. First,
the results lend support and add to a growing body of research that
has identified enduring effects of lynchings during the turn of the
nineteenth century that have persisted to the present (Jacobs et al.
2012;Zimring2003).Thelegacyoflynchingscasts,itappears,along
shadow, one relevant for understanding contemporary race relations
inAmerica(Kingetal.2009;Messneretal.2005;Smˆangs2016).
Second, priorworkhasidentifiedassociationsbetweenlynchings
and capital punishment (Jacobs et al. 2005), homicides (Messner
et al. 2005; Petersen and Ward 2015), law enforcement responses to
hatecrimes(Kingetal.2009),prisonadmissions(Jacobsetal.2012),
white supremacist group activity (Durso and Jacobs 2013), and sup-
port for more punitive sanctioning of black offenders relative to
whiteoffenders(Stewartetal.2018).Althoughthepresentstudydid
not examine whether perceptions of criminal threat contributes to
these outcomes, it illuminates that a central theoretical mechanism
anticipated by past studies—perceived black criminal threat—is itself
associatedwithlynchings.
Third, the present study and prior work collectively point to
the possibility that one legacy of lynchings lies in the “conflation
https://doi.org/10.1111/lasr.12396 Published online by Cambridge University Press510 PerceivedBlackCriminalThreatAmongWhites
ofblacknessandcrime”(Wacquant2001:118)inmodernAmerica.
This conflation may serve to sustain and reinforce views of blacks
as criminalandaslikelyto victimizewhites,andinturntocontrib-
ute to racial disparities in the arrest, prosecution, and punishment
of blacks (Alexander 2012; Chiricos et al. 2004; Mears et al. 2016;
UlmerandLaskorunsky2016;Unnever2014).
Fourth, the results underscore the potential for community
context to moderate the effects of lynchings. It underscores, too,
the attendantneed,as Hochschild(2016)hashighlighted, forana-
lyses that identify how a range of social forces may intersect to
influence whites’ views and, more generally, todinfluence interra-
cial dynamics (Durso and Jacobs2013; Messneret al. 2006; Porter
et al. 2014). For example, disadvantaged areas may provide set-
e
tings, andpolitically conservativeviews mayprovidebeliefsystems
that enable stereotypical views of blacks as criminal to flourish.
Further investigation of these possibtilities is an important, albeit
difficult one, to pursue. Hochschilcd’s 2016 work is illustrative—it
involved intensive qualitative research aimed at demonstrating
the intersection of multiple forces and how they affect American’s
a
views. Our analyses focused on relatively simple two-way interac-
tions. In reality, more complicated interactions of three or more
forces may contribute torhow whites, and citizens more generally,
view blacks. Investigating such interactions may go beyond what
t
conventional data sets allow. They are, however, important for
e
unpacking the ways in which lynchings, and the belief systems
that may have helped to perpetuate, directly, indirectly, or in
interactionwitRh other forces,influencecontemporaryAmerica.
In a related vein, there is a need for research that isolates the
mechanisms that allow for the cultural transmission of views that
whites hold about blacks. Smaˆngs (2016: 1368), for example, has
argued that “racial inequalities, whether in the past or present, can-
notbeunderstoodapartfromprocessesofracialcategory,boundary,
andidentifyformation.”AndGabrielandTolnay(2017)haveunder-
scored the importance of investigating factors, such as legal rulings
andresidentialheterogeneity,thatmayattenuatetheeffectsoflynch-
ing. Connecting past lynching practices and these processes—
including the dynamics and salience of identity formation and the
transmission or inhibition of racial animus—to contemporary whites’
views of blacks and black criminality constitutes a critical avenue of
inquiry for future research (DeFina and Hannon 2011; King and
Wheelock2007;PetersenandWard2015).
Finally, greater attention is needed to ways in which other his-
torical conditions may be relevant in understanding the effects of
lynchings, racial threat processes, and contemporary views whites
hold toward blacks. Acharya et al. (2016), for example, have
argued for the potential role that slavery, and competition among

whitesandblacks,mayplayininfluencingwhites’racialresentment,
politicalaffiliation,andviewsaboutaffirmativeaction(seealsoWells
1970). Although they found no evidence that slavery effects arose
through racial threat processes, the study aligns with studies of
lynchings in pointing to the persistent influence of the past. Future
research ideally will investigate the ways in which social, economic,
andculturaleventsofthepastcombinetoinfluenceracialdynamics
incontemporaryAmerica.
There is no time like the present to do so. In addition to the
considerable attention scholars have given to the study of lynchings,
there is also national interest in understanding adnd acknowledging
the fact of lynchings and their consequences. Perhaps the most
prominent example can be seen in the erection in 2018 of the
e
National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Alabama (Robertson
2018). Its impacts remain to be seen, but its presence signals the
potential for greater efforts to documtent, understand, and address
violenceofallkinds. c

Retraction Note: Evidence of unprecedented rise in growth synchrony from global tree
ring records
Rubén Delgado Manzanedo , Janneke HilleRisLambers, Tim Tito Rademacher and Neil Pederson
Retraction to: Nature Ecology & Evolution https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-01306-x, published online 26 October 2020.
This Article is being retracted by the authors as the result of a coding error, correction of which undermines the main conclusions of the
study. This was an inadvertent error related to the use of the ‘use=pairwise.complete.obs’ option in the function ‘cor.test’. This function
was used to estimate the correlation matrix between all tree-ring series. We had assumed the option pairwise.complete.obs would fully
exclude tree-ring series with incomplete records for each time window. Unfortunately, ‘not available’ (NA) values were excluded only on
a pairwise base between tree-ring series within each time window. This resulted in shorter time series being retained and inconsistent
time windows in recent years and, consequently, a greater chance of higher correlation coefficients. When we excluded all incomplete
tree-ring series for each time window in subsequent analyses, as was our original intention, the recent increase in synchrony originally
reported in this Article (Figs. 2,3) is, unfortunately, mostly an artefact of this coding error. Because our sensitivity analyses all used the
same correlation functions and option, we did not detect this error until S. Klesse, R. Brienen and R. Peters brought it to our attention.
In fact, the consistent response in all sensitivity analyses reinforced our original interpretation. The sub-sampling sensitivity analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 5b) remains unaffected by this coding error, since samples were selected to maintain a constant sample size and
exclude all NAs. However, the increasing synchrony trend in this analysis is of much smaller magnitude and spatial scale than the origi-
nally reported trend, and thus would require examination on its own. Because the main conclusion of this paper is now unsupported, all
authors agree to this retraction. We thank S. Klesse, R. Brienen and R. Peters for quickly detecting and informing us of this error.

Theinitialmorphology-basedidentificationofthesnail

and as a result we did not realise that we had charac-
terised the mitochondrial genome of a different species.
Upon re-examination of our data, we suggest that the
sample “Radix swinhoei” does in fact represent a species
of Physella (referred to as Physella sp.). Because of this
misidentification and the fact that the phylogenetic ana-
lysis did not include members of the family Physidae,
the conclusionsdrawnfromthe“Radix swinhoei”sample
inourarticle areincorrect.

2010–2016
On March 8, 2019, MMWR published “Associations Among
School Absenteeism, Gastrointestinal and Respiratory Illness,
and Income — United States, 2010-2016” (1). On March 18,
2019, the National Center for Health Statistics, which manages
the National Health Interview Survey, notified the authors of
a concern that the analysis had not correctly accounted for the
complex survey design and did not use the imputed income
files or the survey weights. MMWR was informed about these
concerns on March 27, 2019. The authors have corrected these
errors and confirmed that they do not change the interpretation
or the conclusions of the original report. In addition, several
wording changes were made to clarify the text and interpre-
tation. In accordance with December 2017 guidance from
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (2),
MMWR is republishing the report (3). The republished report
includes the original report with clearly marked corrections in
supplementary materials.

Following the publication of this Letter, Beheim and colleagues submit-
ted a Matters Arising in which they argued that our primary results were
called into question by our treatment of missing data1. In our research,
we attempted to test the ‘big gods’ hypothesis even-handedly using the
best available evidence, and we made our data and code available dur-
ing the review process and after publication, in line with best practice
in open science. Nevertheless, we accept that we should have labelled
moralizing gods as ‘absent’ or ‘inferred absent’ rather than ‘unknown’
in portions of our dataset before the dates of the first appearance,
rather than converting ‘NAs’ to zeros during the phase of analysis. Since
this Letter was published, we have thoroughly refined our data and
analyses, and have found that our original conclusions are still strongly
supported2,3. However, the differences between our revised analyses
and the original Letter are substantial enough to warrant a Retraction
of the original Letter. We have submitted the enhanced analyses for
peer review and potential publication in another journal. We encourage
the community to refer to these new papers in future instead of this
now-retracted Letter. We apologize to the scientific community for
the unintended confusion. The authors John Baines, Alan Covey and
Kevin Feeney do not agree with this Retraction.

editorial expression of Concern:
Global analysis of streamflow
response to forest management
Jaivime Evaristo & Jeffrey J. McDonnell
Addendum to: Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1306-0,
published online 17 June 2019.
The editors of Nature have become aware that this Article contains
at least two serious technical errors. First, the assembled dataset of
paired watershed studies, used to assess the streamflow response to
forest removal and planting, contains errors in the percentage change in
streamflow associated with land cover modifications. Second, the effects
of continent-wide forest removal on streamflow (shown in Table 1)
are overestimated, because the authors assumed a starting condition
of 100% forest cover. We are aware that other technical concerns have
also been raised; we are investigating these critiques and will provide
an update once a resolution has been reached. The authors have been
informed of this Editorial Expression of Concern, and are in agreement.

Correction to: Scientific Reports https://doi.org/10.1038/srep04759; published online 23 April 2014; updated
09 February 2018
The authors of the study request that this Article be retracted.
The authors identified an error in the Matlab code used to generate Figure 3 and Figure 4 of the Article. Although
the formulas described in the Article are correct, the mistake in the code led to incorrect estimation of the final
key rate when Eve is present. With the corrected code, the authors find that the existence of Eve will rapidly
increase the estimated error rate, therefore, the attack described in the Article is invalid for the decoy-state QKD
protocol, even if the phase source is unrandomized.
All authors agree to the retraction of the Article.

2. Dual solutions can only be defined and computed if the governing equations are ODEs.
TheauthorshavereducedtheirsystemtoODEform,butthesystemhereshouldbeasetofparabolic

to being self-similar (with ODEs). The authors have thus solved the boundary layer equations
incorrectly. Thisisduetothefactthatthecoefficientsintheboundarylayerequationsarenotconstants,
as assumed by the authors, but are actually functions of the streamwise coordinate, x. Therefore

Retraction Statement
The authors of the article
Yu JL, Li C, Che LH, Xu N, entitled
“Lentivirus-Mediated Gene Silencing of Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen 1 Inhibits
Apoptosis of Hippocampal Neurons in Rats with Acute Cerebral Ischemia After Cerebral
Lymphatic Blockage”
[Cell Physiol Biochem 2018;51(3):1069-1086, DOI:10.1159/000495488]
have requested retraction on the following basis:
In this study, they explored the effects of silencing of LFA-1 on the hippocampus of rats at
different time points (0h, 24h, 48h, and 72h). The correct statistical analysis method should be
repeated measurement ANOVA, while they misused the one-way ANOVA due to the limitation of
our understanding of ANOVA, which might lead to some inaccuracies in this research.
The editors appreciate that the authors have asked to retract their manuscript to avoid misleading

the Logistic regression analysis, but they could not reach
the conclusion consistent with the published results. The
authors are concerned that the conclusions of this article
may mislead other clinical workers and therefore agree to
retract the article.

Retraction of: Scientific Reports https://d oi.o rg/1 0.1 038/s 41598-0 23-4 3475-2, published online 26 September 2023
The Authors have retracted this Article. After the publication of the Article, the Authors discovered that their
TAW-2000 rock testing machine had developed a malfunction. The machine was used in most of the experi-
ments and the Authors cannot be certain at which point the machine failed. The Authors therefore no longer
have confidence in the data.
All Authors agree to this retraction.

The Editor has retracted this article because, owing to an
administration error in the editorial office, it was pub-
lished before the peer review process had been under-
taken. Post-publication peer review has concluded that
the use of hospitalized patients rather than outpatients
would have introduced confounding factors that may
have affected bilirubin levels and their analysis. In addi-
tion, the inclusion of all variables in the both the univari-
ate and multivariate analyses is incorrect. Therefore, after
careful consideration, the Editor has taken the decision
to retract the article given that if these issues had been
highlighted by peer review before publication the article
would not have been accepted. The Publisher apologises
to the authors for the administrative error. The authors
agree with this retraction.

Xiaoyan Qiu, Diego F. M. Oliveira, Alireza Sahami Shirazi, Alessandro Flammini and Filippo Menczer
Retraction of: Nature Human Behaviour https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-017-0132, published online 26 June 2017.
The authors wish to retract this Letter as follow-up work has highlighted that two errors were committed in the analyses used to produce
Figs 4d and 5.
In Fig. 4d, a software bug led to an incorrect value of the discriminative power represented by the blue bar. The correct value is τ = 0.17,
as opposed to the value τ = 0.15 reported in the Letter.
In Fig. 5, the model plot was produced with erroneous data. Produced with the correct data, the authors’ model does not account for
the virality of both high- and low-quality information observed in the empirical Facebook data (inset). In the revised figure shown
below (Fig. 5), the distribution of high-quality meme popularity predicted by the model is substantially broader than that of low-quality
memes, which do not become popular. Thus, the original conclusion, that the model predicts that low-quality information is just as likely
to go viral as high-quality information, is not supported. All other results in the Letter remain valid.

Retraction of: Scientific Reports https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58372-1, published online 30 January 2020
The authors are retracting this Article.
After the publication of this Article it was brought to the authors’ attention that the results obtained for boron
nitride are incorrect. Subsequently, the authors identified an error in Table 1, row 2, where the number of edges
for (2,3) is incorrectly defined as 8(n-2). The correct formula is 8(n-1). As a result of this error, the results and
conclusions reported for boron nitride are invalid.
All authors agree with the retraction.

OPEN Retraction Note: Stay‑at‑home
policy is a case of exception fallacy:
an internet‑based ecological study
R. S. Savaris, G. Pumi, J. Dalzochio & R. Kunst
Retraction of: Scientific Reports https://d oi.o rg/1 0.1 038/s 41598-0 21-8 4092-1, published online 05 March 2021
The Editors have retracted this Article.
Following publication of this Article concerns have been raised about the methodological approach developed
by the Authors to evaluate the impact of stay-at-home policies on the reduction of COVID-19-related fatalities.
In particular, Meyerowitz-Katz et al.1 show that the approach fails to detect any signal when tested on a synthetic
dataset where the ground truth is known, and under specific cases of data subsetting. In addition, Meyerowitz-
Katz et al.1 failed to replicate the original results using a synthetic dataset. These suggest that the false negative
rate of the approach is prohibitively high to allow for meaningful conclusions to be drawn regarding the impact
of stay-at-home policies on COVID-19 fatality rates. The results of Meyerowitz-Katz et al.1 are further confirmed
by Góes2 who, using a pure correlation analysis, shows that the coefficients for the impact of stay-at-home poli-
cies using the methodological approach developed by the Authors can be zero even with diametrically opposing
indices of staying-at-home. Given these concerns, the Editors no longer have confidence that the conclusions
presented are adequately supported.
R.S. Savaris, G. Pumi, J. Dalzochio and R. Kunst do not agree with this retraction.

We, the authors, are regretfully retracting this Article owing to an error
in our computer code that means the quantitative results reported
are not valid. We thank A. Grønlund and D. Sels, whose independent
efforts1,2 pointed to potential problems with our optimization algo-
rithm. The error was identified by A. Grønlund, who has provided a
detailed account3 of the error and its effect on the quantitative results
in our Article. For more recent and comprehensive explorations of the
performance differences between player-seeded and randomly seeded
algorithms, we refer to our recent work4.

The authors have retracted this conference paper [1]. After publication, the authors
discovered a coding error in their simulations of RRS, impacting the results and
conclusions of the article. A summary of the re-analyses of the data can be found
below. All authors agree with this retraction.
In our paper, we present a new data dissemination approach for opportunistic
networks, based on the general idea of combining two existing protocols, which are
used in different scenarios. For our study we have taken two existing and well-known
protocols:EpidemicandRRS(RandomizedRumorSpreading).Previousevaluationsin
simulation of these two protocols have shown that they perform very differently in
differentscenarios:whileEpidemichasaverygooddeliveryrateanddeliverydelay,its
overhead is very high. For RRS, it seemed the opposite to be true: very low overhead
withnotverygooddeliveryrateanddelay.Thesepreliminaryresultslaidthebasisfor
our work - we wanted to combine both to combine also their advantages. The results
we obtained are described in the paper.
Unfortunately, when continuing our work after the publication of our paper, we
discovered a minor error in our simulations of RRS - the statistics of the overhead of
RRSwasnotcomputedcorrectlyandrepresentedonlyafractionofthetrueone.After
re-running all simulations, we realizedthe assumptions, which laid our research basis,
are wrong. RRS had even higher network overhead than Epidemic. The difference
between the new and old data is shown below in Fig. 1.

Thedescribed mistake hadunfortunatelyanimpactonly onthenetwork overhead,
thusleavingtheresultsfordeliverydelayandratethesame.Thus,ourhybridprotocol
does not perform any better than any of the two original protocols.
However, we would like to stress at this point, that we still believe our general
approach of combining two protocols with different performance is a valuable direc-
tion. However, we would need to select two other protocols for this, since RRS and
Epidemic are not a good match.
We apologize once again to you and to the scientific community for this mistake.
